Startups,EV startup Ather seeks to raise $370 million in India IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/ev-startup-ather-seeks-to-raise-370-million-in-india-ipo/,"2:23 AM PDT • September 9, 2024","Comment Indian electric scooter manufacturer Ather Energy plans to raise about $370 million by issuing fresh shares in an initial public offering, according to itsdraft prospectus filed on Monday(PDF), as the startup seeks to capitalize on growing demand for electric vehicles in the world’s third-largest auto market. The Bengaluru-based lossmaking startup, which competes withrecently listed rival Ola Electric, said it will also sell up to 22 million shares from existing investors in the IPO. The firm is targeting a valuation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Ather Energy declined to comment. The startup,backed by India’s Hero MotoCorpand sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, said it will use the proceeds to fund a new manufacturing facility in Maharashtra state, repay borrowings and invest in research and development. Ather Energy commanded about 19% of the electric two-wheeler market as of August-end, according to official government data. Ola Electric leads the market with a 31% share, whereas TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto hold 20% and 19% market share, respectively. Hero has about 5% of the market share. Traditional giants are increasingly ramping up their focus on the EV market — and delivering results. Bajaj Auto’s market share stood at 11% at the end of June this year, for instance, when Ola Electric had about 46% of the market. Ather’s IPO plans come as India’s electric vehicle market heats up, driven by government incentives and rising fuel prices. The country aims to have 30% of private cars and 70% of commercial vehicles running on electricity by 2030. Founded in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, Ather is known for its in-house design approach, with 80% of key components designed internally. Ather raised about $500 million across several rounds, according to Tracxn. The startup reported losing $126 million to generate a revenue of $213 million for the fiscal year ending March. Ather faces stiff competition from well-funded startups and established automakers rushing to grab a slice of India’s rapidly growing electric two-wheeler market. Rival Ola Electric went public last month, while traditional players like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have also entered the electric scooter space. Axis Capital, HSBC, JM Financial and Nomura are book-running lead managers for Ather’s IPO. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startups,Elon Musk says Tesla has ‘no need’ to license xAI models,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-no-need-to-license-xai-models/,"10:41 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Elon Musk has denied a report that one of his companies, Tesla, has discussed sharing revenue with another of his companies, xAI, so that it can use the startup’s AI models. The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterdaythat under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus. Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter),Musk saidhe hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.” “Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.” Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left).TechCrunch reported earlier this yearthat as part of the pitch forxAI’s $6 billion funding round, the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies. Tesla shareholders have sued Muskover the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startups,La French Tech gears up to go in a new direction,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/la-french-tech-gears-up-to-go-in-a-new-direction/,"9:43 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment After weeks in political limbo, France now has a new prime minister, former EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. But parliament remainsbitterly divided, generating uncertainty for many economic sectors — including the country’s dynamic startup ecosystem, which had so far benefited from public support. La French Tech isn’t just a term referring to France’s 25,000 startups; it is also an initiative supported by a public administration, theFrench Tech Mission, whose director, Clara Chappaz, is departing this month as her three-year contract ends, she told Les Échos. The timing is coincidental, but also noteworthy. Her replacement, she told TechCrunch in late August, should hopefully be someone who is “not afraid of change” and sees it as an opportunity. The role is undoubtedly unique. It’s attached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, but with a lean team working out ofStation Fand with a big mission: to support the structuring and growth of the French startup ecosystem of startups, in France and abroad. It requires someone who is equally able to talk to public officials, politicians, big companies and journalists. It is now too late to apply, but seeing how it has been described as a “dream job,” there should be enough candidates on the ranks; Chappaz, who won’t be part of the jury, said when we talked in August that she was taking several calls a day from prospective candidates. She likely told them pretty much the same as she told TechCrunch andher LinkedIn followers: That France is “incredibly lucky” to have its French Tech Mission and that her experience at its helm was “exceptional.” But what happened in the past isn’t indicative of the future, and whoever succeeds Chappaz will operate in a scenario that’s very different from when she took charge in 2021. That’s because La French Tech itself has changed during those years, pushing new priorities for the French Tech Mission. Chappaz experienced her fair share of change over the last three years, too, and not only because there were three different secretaries of state for digital affairs over that same period; that’s common in a lot of public administrations. The main change had to do with tech itself, and with the macro context: 2024 is quite different from 2021. Just like elsewhere, French startups went through the ebbs and flows of the pandemic and the fundraising hype that ensued, only tocome back to eartha few months later. Geopolitical unrest followed, and alongside came the realization that countries needed industrial champions to rely on. For the French Tech Mission, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2023, this meant aligning with the strategic France 2030 agenda. There cameFrench Tech 2030, with less focus on unicorns, and more on deep tech spinouts and economic impact. Not that it was responsible for the former: President Emmanuel Macron was the one who set out“25 French unicorns”as a goal to reach by 2025. (After reaching that milestone in 2022, he went on to call for 100 unicorns by 2030.) That France now has scaleups like BlaBlaCar and Doctolib is no small feat, and telling the world certainly did favors to its image. But10 years after the “unicorn” moniker was coined, global tech has moved on. It was time for France to acknowledge that its startups have changed, too, with the rise ofcompanies like Mistral AI and Pasqal(and the fall of others, likeLuko.) The France Digitale association, which represents startups and investors from the French digital ecosystem, has been well placed to witness this evolution among its members since its creation in 2012. “There are [now] startups in all sectors, in manufacturing, in healthcare, which are also sectors that I think are strategic priorities for the competitiveness of France and for the sovereignty of France and Europe,” its CEO Maya Noël told TechCrunch. In line with this evolution, Nöel said it might be interesting for Chappaz’s replacement to come from one of these strategic sectors, but that’s no jab at her background (Chappaz joined from Vestiaire Collective, a second-hand fashion marketplace) or at her predecessors. From our conversation with Noël, it transpired that the two structures are “fairly aligned” and have been in “constant dialogue.” Several initiatives adopted under Chappaz’s leadership reflect what the sector has been lobbying for. One example is“Je Choisis La French Tech,” an initiative that saw 300 companies and 80 institutional players commit to helping double the number of public contracts and purchases from startups. “We have been asking for this for 10 years,” Noël said. If anything, France Digitale wished things could go faster, for instance on the hot topic of exits (or dearth thereof). Someone with first-hand knowledge of scaleups and international expansion could add value at its helm, but a new director with a public service background might be able to pull strings on the administration side if La French Tech were to lack governmental support, Noël said. La French Tech Mission has arguments that could play well with different sides of the political support: that startups are directly and indirectly responsible for1.1 million jobs, and for helping reindustrialize France. Many people also committed to theParity Pactpromoted by Chappaz and her team to foster gender equality in the tech industry. Her successor will have to play these cards well, and we wish them “bonne chance.” That also goes for Chappaz, too, who is expecting her second child and says she hasn’t decided yet what she will do next, but that it’ll have to do with tech innovation.

Startups,Sunamp’s thermal battery uses a chemical found in salt-and-vinegar potato chips,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/sunamps-thermal-battery-uses-a-chemical-found-in-salt-and-vinegar-potato-chips/,"7:00 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Nearly 20 years ago, Andrew Bissell was sitting in the living room of his beachfront home in the Edinburgh area. He and his wife, Susan Lang-Bissell, had just sold their medical imaging startup, and he was pondering his future. “Do we retire or do we go again?” Bissell told TechCrunch. Around that time, he was leafing through a science magazine when he stumbled across an article about climate change, which said there could be between a 30 cm to 1 meter rise in sea level before the end of the century. “Hang on,” he said to himself. “If that happens, then the living room, the ground floor of this home that we live in, will be underwater twice a day. Then you start thinking about that being in hundreds of millions of other homes around the world. That’s not acceptable.” Rather than join Greenpeace — “that’s not really what we do” — he and his wife foundedSunamp. They worked with a lab at the University of Edinburgh to devise a way to store solar power as heat that can then be used for household heating or hot water, what’s known as a thermalbattery. At the heart of Sunamp’s thermal battery are three compounds: sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT), a food flavoring used in salt-and-vinegar potato chips; water; and a sprinkling of so-called crystal habit modifiers. SAT has been used for years in hand warmers, which are prepared by heating the substance until it dissolves into a supersaturated solution. When triggered, SAT recrystallizes, giving off heat in the process. The reaction can be reversed, allowing SAT to store heat for later use, but not indefinitely. Eventually, the salt settles out of solution and refuses to recrystallize. To improve the longevity of SAT, Sunamp uses a form of acrylic as a crystal habit modifier, which helps guide the SAT into the proper configuration time and again. “That’s both weird and exciting. Weird that it happens, but exciting because it means that now, instead of [SAT] getting worse and worse over time, it just stays the same,” Bissell said, adding that the substance, which Sunamp calls Plentigrade, will last up to 40,000 heating cycles, or more than 50 years of daily use. The goal is to make use of excess renewable power, charging the thermal battery when solar is plentiful or rates are cheap because the wind is blowing. Overnight or when the wind stops blowing, the battery can discharge, releasing heat as the SAT crystalizes. Sunamp already has a foothold in the United Kingdom and Italy, and it’s working to expand into other Western European countries and the U.S. The company is in the process of raising a Series B, and Bissell said that it is generating revenue in the “tens of millions range.” The startup’s first widely available product, a compact heat battery for domestic hot water, is targeted at customers for whom space is a premium. “Globally, maybe half of homes can afford the space to put a hot water tank in,” Bissell said. “We’re for the other ones, the ones that can’t afford that space.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startups,The coolest startup in the Bay Area is a baseball team called the Oakland Ballers,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/the-coolest-startup-in-the-bay-area-is-a-baseball-team-called-the-oakland-ballers/,"6:00 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment The most cliche advice for startup founders is to identify a problem in your life and find a way to solve it. A founder with multiple exits under his belt, Paul Freedman, has a big problem: His beloved Oakland A’s aremoving to Las Vegas by way of Sacramento. “It’s interesting how much a sports team impacts the psyche of a town,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “And if a team ever makes the decision to abandon the town, it creates heartbreak. Fans have described it like a death in the family, and the death is the family member who threw all the parties.” For Oakland sports fans, this collective grief is familiar, which makes it even more devastating. The A’s will be the third professional sports team to leave Oakland in the last five years; the Golden State Warriors of the NBA moved across the Bay to San Francisco in 2019, and the NFL’s Raiders set up shop in Las Vegas in 2020. So when billionaire A’s owner John Fisher announced he was taking the team out of Oakland, fans fought back. In 2023, at a Tuesday night game against the Tampa Bay Rays, they participated in a “reverse boycott.” Nearly 30,000 were in attendance, some wearing Kelly green T-shirts with the word “SELL” emblazoned across them,all chanting “sell the team”at various points throughout the game. That fight carried through to this season. On Opening Day, another reverse boycott was held, with fans this timegathering in the stadium parking lotto protest the move. Throughout the season, A’s fans made a statement in the backgrounds of national broadcasts, waving “SELL” flags to pressure Fisher to hand the A’s off to a new owner — one who cares about the team’s 56-year legacy in Oakland. Unfortunately, Freedman and his business partner, television producer Bryan Carmel, can’t just buy the A’s. But while they may not have$1.2 billionto throw around, they realized they could start their own team. So with a dash of spite, Freedman and Carmel founded an independent baseball team called theOakland Ballers— the Oakland B’s for short. This year, the B’s made their debut in the Pioneer League, a professional baseball organization that’s partnered with the MLB, but unlike the minor leagues, it’s not tied to any existing MLB teams. “What is needed is a team that represents the community and is there to provide the kind of experiences that have always been there,” Freedman said. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be fully a replacement product. We’re never going to be an MLB team, but it doesn’t mean we can’t provide some of the same experiences and some of the same joy that [the A’s] did.” Thanks to Freedman and Carmel, there will be baseball in Oakland next year after all. But now, the founders are faced with a new problem. How do you get thousands of lifelong A’s fans to care about a glorified minor league team that plays in a renovated Little League park? For Freedman, the answer is to take what he’s learned in building and advising startups and apply it to a baseball team. It may not sound glamorous, but it’s working. “We’ve approached this very much like a startup,” he said. “We raised a $2 million seed round, and then built our ballpark literally from the ground up. And we’re doing things that startups do, like iteration, A/B testing … I think it’s a competitive advantage because we’re taking a very different approach to how you would build this thing typically in sports.” Before Freedman was a serial entrepreneur, he was an A’s fan. He grew up in Chicago, cheering for the White Sox, but when he was in high school, his family relocated to Oakland. When he started following A’s baseball, the Bay Area began to feel like home. “It’s really the A’s who have brought me into the Oakland communities where I’ve met a lot of my friends,” Freedman said. “Now, I’ve lived here for 30 years, and have chosen to live in Oakland. I choose to raise my kids in Oakland, even though I could have moved to Palo Alto and been with everybody else doing startup stuff.” By the late 1990s, before Freedman had even gotten his bachelor’s degree, he had already founded his first edtech startup, which was an enrollment chatbot that answered students’ questions about college. He sold that company to Hobsons, and after working at the edtech giant for a few years, he foundedAltius Education, a Series B startup that sought to make higher education more accessible through a low-cost, online associate’s degree program. The startup flamed out, but it earned Freedman enough respect in the venture world to found Entangled Group, an edtech incubator that was later acquired byGuild Education. Freedman’s transition from education to baseball is a bit out of left field. But whether he’s advising new edtech entrepreneurs or constructing a stadium on a tight budget, Freedman has always wanted to build companies that make the world better. “Every investment or every business I’ve ever tried to do, I’ve tried to make it an impact business. I’ve taken a long time to decide: Is this both good for the world and a good business?” he said. “I actually spent a long time philosophically deciding whether sports was good for the world … should we be doing other things? What is it about sports? And then ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the magic of sports is the way it brings communities, particularly diverse communities, together.” Freedman has spent the last 30 years of his life reveling in that magic firsthand. He thinks about how it feels to take public transit right after a sporting event, when everyone in the train car is united by their shared love of the home team. “Normally when people are on public transportation, they’re on their phones, they’re not talking to anybody,” he said. “But you take that same train and you put it after a game where the team won, and everyone’s high-fiving and hugging like it’s their family. It’s the same train, same context, but sports creates this community layer.” When Freedman builds and advises startups, he tells founders to align their business incentives with their mission. He’s taken this same approach when laying the foundation for the Ballers. In the past, his mission has been to build tech that makes education more accessible. Now, the mission is to give Oakland baseball fans a thriving community and a team that’s worth cheering for. “We believe that if you center your fans, and you know their experience in the community is fundamentally what the whole thing is about, then you kind of force yourself to make sure you’re doing right by them,” Freedman said. An Oakland Ballers game looks a bit different than an MLB game because the Pioneer League itself is a bit different. “We can innovate in ways that other leagues and other teams can’t, if you believe that testing and iteration and incremental improvement is the pathway for a better product,” Freedman said. When Pioneer League games end in a tie, they don’t move on to extra innings. Instead, there’s an impromptu Home Run Derby to decide the winner. “It’s really cool, it’s super fan-friendly, and it’s electric when it happens,” Freedman said. “People even start rooting for ties at the end of the game to see the Home Run Derby. That kind of experimentation can ultimately lead to a better experience.” The Ballers recently took a big swing and partnered withFan Controlled Sports, an app that allows fans to make real-time decisions about the game like they’re the manager. It’s a move that would wreak havoc in an MLB game, but works in a Pioneer League setting. “It demonstrates both a willingness to experiment, and a willingness to make mistakes, even if in public, and an iterative approach,” Freedman said. The Ballers have indeed put their money where their mouth is. They opened up partial ownership of the franchise to the fans. In an oversubscribed, fan-driven funding round, the team raised over $1.235 million from about 2,200 people. “One of the things I always advise startups on is to ensure investor alignment,” Freedman said. “With us, it’s like, do your owners want the same thing? And fan owners, we believe, want exactly the same thing — what we want to do is bring joy to fans, and we think the way to do that is to create a great experience.” The Ballers haven’t even finished their first season yet, but the team offers a glimmer of hope to forlorn A’s fans who have less than a month left to watch their lifelong favorite team play in Oakland. At its best, tech challenges the status quo, and Freedman is doing just that by showing fans that they don’t have to live by the whims of billionaire sports team owners. This isn’t something Freedman only learned from tech, though. His focus on his mission comes from spending most of his life in Oakland. “I’m generally a tech-forward thinker and think that there’s a lot of benefits that technology can have to most elements of our world,” Freedman said. “But there’s a lot tech can learn from Oakland.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Venture,European VC Atomico closes $1.24B across two funds for early and growth-stage startups,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/european-vc-atomico-closes-1-24b-across-two-funds-for-early-and-growth-stage-startups/,"4:02 PM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment As European startups continue tolook for signs of sustained market confidencebeyond the hype around AI companies,Atomico— one of the region’s more iconic, largest venture capital firms — has raised more money to make investments that might indicate how the market is really moving. The VC has closed new funds totalling $1.24 billion to back early- and growth-stage startups across the region. London-based Atomico is describing this as its “largest ever fundraise,” although technically it is across two pots of money. “Atomico Venture VI” weighs in at $485 million for mostly Series A-stage companies (with some reserved for seed), and a separate $754 million fund — dubbed “Atomico Growth VI” — is for Series B through pre-IPO. Raising and allocating money from separate funds is typical of many venture capital firms today, but that Atomico closed two separate funds, led by separate teams, is notable. The firm has historically leaned toward earlier funding rounds while dipping into later stages where it made sense. Now it’s setting itself up to focus just as much on the later stages of a startup’s journey with a dedicated fund. This move could also point to a trepidation among some in the investor fraternity who are hesitant to put money into fledgling pre-profit companies. By setting things up this way, it becomes easier for Atomico to bring contributions from more risk-averse limited partners (LPs) into the fray by enabling them to channel their cash into tried and tested businesses, rather than backing a single fund that may span anything from seed to Series F. The news also comes amidsta downturn in the global venture capital sphere, a trend to which Europe has not been impervious. Among the things on which Atomico has built a reputation is its annual research reports on the state of the European technology ecosystem, which focus on how the venture capital end of the market is faring. Its most recent report made for grim reading, noting that amid an ongoing downturn, European startup fundinghalved in 2023, driven by factors such as geopolitical events, inflation, and interest rates. It also determined that the market, and investment data, had been skewed by 2021 and 2022 because of the global pandemic European VC funding last yearwas actually slightly above pre-pandemic figures. An optimist would interpret that as a sign that the tech market may be on better footing than the darker data might suggest.Q2 2024 datacouldsupport that thesis, as would a swathe of new funds from several prominent VC firms in the region. Back in May,Accel announced a fresh $650 million fundfor early-stage startups, while more recentlyBalderton unlocked $1.3 billion across two new funds— $615 million for early-stage, and $685 million for growth-stage. Founded in 2006 bySkype co-founder Niklas Zennström, Atomico launched initially with a $73 million fund, and in the near two decades since it launched a$165 million fund II(2010);$476.6 million fund III(2013);$765 million fund IV(2017); and$820 million fund V(2020). Atomico’s latest fund surpasses its last by more than 50%. However, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last year, Atomico was seeking$600 millionand$750 millionrespectively for its venture and growth funds. In short, while it surpassed its target on the growth side, Atomico fell short of its venture target by nearly 20%. On the one hand, it makes more sense for Atomico to allocate more cash to later stage companies given that its portfolio of investments has grown over time. What were once early-stage companies are now in full scale-up mode, requiring more money than ever. On the other hand, falling short of its funding target for earlier-stage startups is indicative that fewer investors are willing to back fledgling companies than Atomico had hoped. Atomico says that it has already made some 21 investments across both funds, including several from Atomico Growth VI into its portfolioincluding DeepL, andPelago, as well as leading on the Series B round ofCorti. In the earlier-stage realm, Atomico Venture VI hasplowed cash into Neko Health,Ben,Dexory,Deeploi,Strise, andLakera, dating back to when the fund first opened in early 2022. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Venture,"Startups are getting fined, or sometimes banned, by individual states",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/07/startups-are-getting-fined-or-sometimes-banned-by-individual-states/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 7, 2024","Comment In 2022, Carta’s business license was revoked in Illinois for failing to pay franchise tax, a tax on national corporations doing business in the state, according to state records seen by TechCrunch. In 2024, Washington state terminated cap table software Pulley’s business license, according to state filings. Carta spokesperson Amanda Taggart told TechCrunch that the company just missed the proper timeline to file its yearly report and pay the corresponding tax. Taggart added that the company has remedied the situation and is waiting on Illinois to return it to good standing. Yin Wu, the founder and CEO of Pulley, said that the company has filed the outstanding returns and is in the process of getting its license reinstated. Startups like Carta and Pulley are definitely not alone in running afoul of state business rules. Plus, while these companies both had registered in these states as required and ran into issues later, many startups don’t begin the registration process in each state when they should at all. When startups have employees in a state, conduct an acquisition or sign up customers there, they typically need to register in the state and maintain themselves in good standing. That includes paying their state taxes and fees on an ongoing basis, Andrea Schulz, a lawyer at Grant Thorton, told TechCrunch. If they don’t, they risk being fined by the state, or other consequences. The problem, experts say, is that each state has its own complex fees, tax, and business registration requirements. And state-level compliance isn’t something top-of-mind for startup founders, nor is it a priority for an early-stage founder’s precious budget dollars, Schulz said. “In some cases every dollar is going to the customer-facing solution,” Schulz said. “That is really why it ultimately happens. It’s not that it is too onerous, or a lack of expertise in that area.” Schulz says that, when founders do misstep on state rules and fees, the fines or other issues may not come to light until a startup is being acquired, thinking of going public, or going through an audit. Ginger Mutoza, a paralegal and corporate legal operations manager at contact center software company 8×8, told TechCrunch that she’s seen that first hand. She said her company is currently working to clean up the compliance of a company it acquired, issues which came to light after the due diligence process. “They took the easy way out. They didn’t report any other mergers or stock option issuance to employees. We have to go back past the statue of limitations for tax claims,” Mutoza said. “We have to recreate history with a company. It becomes very expensive fixing those errors. They can just compound year over year over year.” The main reason state-level compliance is so hard for startups is that the states don’t make it easy. Each state wants different information in different formats to keep companies in good standing. Robert Holdheim, the COO of back office and compliance platform Traact, told TechCrunch the company has yet to have a customer come to its platform that had all of its state compliance properly accounted for — even if they thought they did. “I have the same attitude that everyone else does: it is a pain in the ass,” Holdheim said. “This is one of the areas that has always been left up to the states. They all do something completely different. There is no ability to easily access information. There’s very little digital information. You have to call in and wait for hours and hours.” Illinois, that state that booted Carta, is particularly known for being difficult. For example, Illinois still only takes paper filings and payments by check. The rules vary on when a startup needs to register, too. In terms of customers, some states require registration when a company is doing a vaguely worded “substantial amount” of business in a state, Mutoza said. Most states do require registration when employees are located there, says Bruno Drummond, founder and partner at CPA and consulting firm Drummond Advisors. If a company tells their employees they can work from wherever, they are setting themselves up to have to file a foreign business entity every time someone moves to a new state. Many don’t keep up. The good news for most startups is that the consequences of getting state rules wrong are typically relatively mild. Companies pay the back taxes and the fines and get back into good standing. However, the consequences could be more severe. If a startup’s state fines and issues are too onerous, this could be a catalyst for an acquirer to walk away, if it doesn’t want to pay to clean up the mess, Schulz said. Not being a legal business entity in a state may also impact a startup’s legal protections in that state. “If you are not in good standing in a certain state as an entity, officially every legal protection that entity has is suspended,” Holdheim said, pointing to Texas specifically. “If somebody sues you in Texas and your Texas entity is not in good standing, you automatically lose. You can’t appear in court if you don’t have legal protections in that state.” He’s referring toSection 9.051of the Texas Business Organizations Code, which prevents unregistered businesses from defending themselves against lawsuits in state courts. The same may go for initiating lawsuits in a state if the startup isn’t in good standing – like suing another business for using the startup’s proprietary intellectual property. Drummond said that startups may also be dropping the ball in other areas like sales tax. He added that companies that have more than $50 million in investment or revenue need to file a monthly report with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, but most don’t. Hiring folks outside of the U.S. further complicates compliance too. The upshot is that state-level regulations need to be factored into a founder’s business plans as soon as feasible, be it through investing in compliance software or through hiring legal experts. Traact isn’t the only company that can help startups stay up-to-date on state compliance. Mosey is another venture-backed startup. DFIN and Vanta are larger companies that offer compliance services. “These entrepreneurs, founders, they kick the ball and then they run after the ball, they don’t plan, they don’t say I’m going to kick itthatdirection,” Drummond said. “Everytime they kick the ball there is some kind of compliance to fulfill to not get penalties.” Powered byWordPress VIP"

This was particularly noticeable, as it’s still much smaller than Meta’s Threads and its200 million monthly active users. Chat battle: Anthropiclaunched Claude Enterprise, a subscription plan for businesses interested in using its AI chatbot, but with admin tools and more security safeguards. It will compete with OpenAI’sChatGPT Enterprise. Thrown towel: Not long after it raised a $500 million Series B round, German AI startup Aleph Alphais pivoting away from the LLM fightand into AI support with the launch of a new product called PhariaAI. Still kicking: NightCafe doesn’t get as much publicity as rival Midjourney, but its AI-powered art creation tools have over 25 million users. This also translates into earnings; a source told TechCrunch that NightCafemakes $4 million in annualized revenue. Piggyback: HR and payroll software company Paylocityagreed to acquire corporate spend startup Airbase for $325 million, almost less than half of its 2021 $600 million valuation. Founder Thejo Kote said Paylocity’s size and scale will help bring Airbase to a much larger audience. More funding is another way to try to get ahead of competitors, but so are differentiation, innovation and going for new markets. Three months later: Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the mere-months-old startup co-founded by Ilya Sutskever of OpenAI fame, has raisedover $1 billion, reportedly at a $5 billion valuation. AI agents: With$50 million in fresh funding, You.com is narrowing down its focus — it hopes to turn its AI into a productivity engine that will solve complex search queries. Hospital at home: Doccla, a British virtual ward startup that helps hospitals remotely manage patients, raised$46 million for its European expansion. Microcapsules: French clean tech startup Calyxia, a B Corp, raised a $35 million Series B round that will help itproduce alternatives to microplastics, a growing pollution concern. MENA fintech: Dubai-based YC alum Ziina raiseda $22 million Series A round to keep growing its P2P payments app, which already counts 50,000 retail and business customers. Proven: PruVen Capital, a fintech and insurtech venture firm founded by Ramneek Gupta, a former Battery Ventures and Citi Ventures VC, closeda $378.5 million second fund. Unlike its first fund, which had Prudential Financial as its main LP, this new vintage is also backed by others. Mainstream climate: The fourth climate-focused fund raised by Dutch firm SET Venturesclosed at €200 million, twice the size of its previous one. It will be deployed into 20 to 25 European early-stage startups making renewable energy more mainstream. AI incubator: VC firm Mayfield Fund allocated$100 million to its newly launched AI Garage, an incubator for ideation-stage founders interested in building “AI teammate” companies. Palantir’s CTO Shyam Sankar has become“a secret weapon for Valley defense tech startups,”TechCrunch’s Margaux MacColl reported. One of its earliest employees, he started a program called First Breakfast in 2023 that doesn’t provide breakfast but does offer a set of software tools that can give new defense tech startups a leg up.

Venture,VC pitch show ‘Meet the Drapers’ partners with TikTok,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/vc-pitch-show-meet-the-drapers-partners-with-tiktok/,"9:44 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Venture capitalist Tim Draper’s international pitch competition, “Meet the Drapers,” is partnering up withTikTokas it heads into its seventh season. Under the new tie-up, entrepreneurs will pitch their startups to the public through the short-form video app for one of the show’s upcoming episodes. The general public will then be able to vote on their favorite submissions through a landing page in the app followed by a livestreamed pitch review on TikTok. This will all culminate in the selection of four finalists, who will compete on an episode of the show in front of judges in hopes of winning the $1 million investment from Tim Draper. For TikTok, the deal allows the company to position itself as a champion for small businesses at a time when its platform is under anincreasingly unpopular U.S. ban, while also allowing it to promote its educational offerings. Meanwhile, “Meet the Drapers” will benefit from the increased visibility provided by the popular video app. While shows like “Shark Tank” have brought the idea of the pitch-off competition to the mainstream public, “Meet the Drapers” explores tech entrepreneurship more directly. “We’re not looking for somebody who invented a gum scraper or…a new bikini company. That isn’t really what we’re after,” theentertaining and iconoclasticinvestor tells TechCrunch. “We’re funding something that 10 years from now is going to rock the world,” he adds. The episodes being developed in partnership with TikTok will likely lean toward consumer technology, given the platform and its audience. This is the first time “Meet the Drapers” has ever worked with TikTok. The show was previously streamed across various platforms, including its own website and YouTube, where the shows average half a million views. The program caters to a global audience, with shows filmed in areas including Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE (Dubai), Denmark and Taiwan, in addition to Silicon Valley — often in conjunction with Draper’s travels and speaking engagements in those markets. Plus, Draper believes that an entrepreneur can start from anywhere, which is why he appreciates the pitch-off show’s global footprint. “We actually think of this show as proselytizing and spreading entrepreneurship in kind of a viral way,” Draper says. The pitches generally focus on areas that Draper likes to invest in, including space and transportation, the digitization of medicine, AI, bitcoin and more. The seventh season of the show has already been filmed and is being readied for release, making the TikTok partnership a part of season eight. Guest judges for the TikTok show have not yet been announced. Small businesses that want to be considered will showcase their entrepreneurial journey in 30- to 60-second TikTok videos. Applications are accepted through Saturday, September 7. The first round of finalists will participate in a livestreamed pitch review event September 25-27, and the overall winner will be announced September 30. Typically, Draper sets aside more cash than the million-dollar prize to award to show participants, which means even runners-up will gain a smaller investment. On the show’s website, it’s noted that the second-place winner receives $500,000 and third place gets $250,000. “We never talk about this, but we always allocate about two to three million per year,” Draper notes. Last year, for instance, the runner-up got a half-million investment while others received $250,000 investments. A small handful of past participants have also received $50,000 investments. One of the more notable winners of the show has been tiny-home startup Boxabl, though that company hasstruggled to reach profitability, and has been underSEC inquiry. Other winners have included at-home health testing serviceVivoo,CancerFree Biotech, drone startupBONV, team collaboration softwareBalloonand health food companyIt’s Skinny. In the finale, the entrepreneurs also have to reveal their valuation, he adds. In total, Draper estimates the show has made somewhere around 35 to 40 investments to date. Overall, as an investor, Draper has backed companies like Baidu, Hotmail, Skype, Tesla, SpaceX, AngelList, SolarCity, Ring, Twitter, Docusign, Coinbase, Robinhood, Twitch, Cruise and others, as well as, more controversially,Theranos.

Venture,Real estate revolutions and beanie baby economies,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/real-estate-revolutions-and-beanie-baby-economies/,"7:05 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment TheEquitypodcast crew is wrapping up another eventful week, with real estate, AI agents, gambling and secondary markets — which are, of course, a form of legalized gambling. Mary Ann Azevedo, Becca Szkutak and Devin Coldewey started off this Friday’s episode with the acknowledgment that theX/Twitter bansituation in Brazil is possibly too complicated an issue to even have an opinion on. Let us cook on that for a bit. In the deals of the week, Devin first talked aboutYou.com’s $50 million playto take on more difficult AI tasks, things that can’t be solved with a quick Google search. The company is hoping to be the go-to for complex stuff that mixes live search, coding and natural language understanding — and unlike a lot of its competition, some of its customers actually pay for themselves! Becca, as someone who hazards a buck on a game now and then, is intrigued byDubClub, a startup that claims to systematize and legitimize professional betting handicappers. These are folks who claim to be able to beat the odds, but tend to offer their services by more informal methods. Can DubClub make a clean business out of this popular, but legally fraught, line of work? A nine-figure deal is always worth chatting about, and Mary Ann brings upPaylocity’s acquisition of Airbasefor $325 million — though, as she points out, the real value of the deal is probably even higher. It’s a lot of money, yes, but compared with earlier valuations… no? Somehow we don’t think founder Thejo Kote is shedding too many tears over it. Anyone who’s bought a house or tried knows the sting of the realtor’s fee. How many percent? Well, due to a recent court ruling overturning an established business practice in real estate, percentage fees may be on their way out — if startupLandianhas its way. They want to make flat fees and pay-on-close the standard. Redfin isnot amused! But they aren’t mad either, or so they’d like us to think. Investing in AI is so popular people areinvesting in the investorsinvesting in AI — on the secondary market, where positions on Anthropic, OpenAI and xAI are now commanding a staggering 30% premium. That gives the actual equity holders a lot of leeway, and potentially gives smaller investors a chance to ride the hype train, but it also gives the whole thing the feel of, as Devin put it, “a beanie baby economy.” That reference is just for the millennials as a “thank you” for listening.

Apple,Apple Intelligence delays could impede iPhone 16 ‘supercycle’,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-intelligence-delays-could-impede-iphone-16-supercycle/,"12:25 PM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment When Apple unveiled itsAI plans at WWDC in June, analystssuggestedthe feature could put the iPhone 16 on track for another “supercycle.” Like the addition of5Gbefore it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence’s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device. We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s“It’s Glowtime”event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it’s believed that Apple Intelligence’s slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential. In June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience.Trained on small models— instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — Apple’s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI. AsBloomberg notestoday, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16’s bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we’reunlikely to seemany delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China — the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch. In the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there’s still a lot of catching up to do. At the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow’s event is set to change that, especially asfurther rumorspoint to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros. While sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company’s bottom line than a staggered rollout.

Apple,"Apple Event 2024: iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence and all the other expected ‘Glowtime’ reveals",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-event-2024-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-and-all-the-other-expected-glowtime-reveals/,"7:26 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Update 9/8:As ever, additional rumors have popped up in the days leading up to the event. Among the more interesting of recent vintage (all Apple Watch related): The Apple Watch Series 10’s blood pressure monitoring isnotcomingto the Watch Ultra 2, limited Apple Intelligence features for the Watch, though it will be baked into afuture fitness coach-style feature. Both models are reportedly getting that sleep apnea feature, though itlikely won’t be available at launch. Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at itsSeptember 9“It’s Glowtime”event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays. The livestream kicks off onMonday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most. Back at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name —Apple Intelligence— which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The “small model” method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it’s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience. That’s a marked difference between it and much larger “black box” models like OpenAI’s andGoogle’s Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence’s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as — at the very least — all of generative AI is, at the end of the day. The answer for how this all ties into “Glowtime” can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced amuch-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing. Out of every iPhone ever launched,two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that’s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro’s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter. With all of this in mind, next week’s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line. We’re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what’s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you’re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out. That will reportedly bump the Pro Max’s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device’s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches. Camera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunchis a new glass molded lensthat is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don’t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart. Leakeddummy modelsfrom early in the year give us a rough idea of each model’s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new “Capture” button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities. The most welcome change, however, may bebigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additionalreports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks. The Pro models are alsoexpected to gainWi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard. As hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it’d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor — something especially important when discussing a watch. Like the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor — the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn’t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but asBloomberg notes, Apple’slegal woes with Masimomay well trip up that feature. A long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week. Stay with me onthis one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its productsto comply with EU mandates. So, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We’ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we’re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however,finallyget the over-earAirPods Max 2,four years after the original. This one is a big maybe.Recent reportingsuggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac’s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big,USB-A-less version of the Mac Miniis said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro. Here’s what we can say for sure: Apple’s Glowtime event is scheduled for Monday, September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. As always, we’ll be there, bringing it to you live. Powered byWordPress VIP"

Apple,How Apple Intelligence is changing the way you use Siri on your iPhone,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/how-apple-intelligence-is-changing-the-way-you-use-siri-on-your-iphone/,"4:39 AM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment Following years of talk aroundApple’s lack ofinnovationwhen it comes to Siri, Apple has promised the launch of a smarter version of its digital assistant coming this fall.Siri is getting a slew of new featuresand updates thanks to the addition ofApple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI offering, and apartnership with OpenAI. From ChatGPT integration to the ability to type instead of speak to Siri, there’s a lot of ways Siri will change in the coming months. Here’s a look at what the introduction ofApple Intelligencewill allow you to do with the revamped digital assistant. We’ll learn more about Apple’s plans for Siri at itsiPhone event that starts at 10 a.m. Monday. Wealso expect to see new AirPods, a new Apple Watch and perhaps even new Macs. Siri will soon be able to tap intoOpenAI’s ChatGPTto answer certain questions. For example, if you need recipe ideas to make a meal using some ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri, and Siri will automatically feed that info to ChatGPT to generate some options for you. You can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to documents or PDFs. For example, say you come across a flower you like while on a walk but don’t know what it’s called. You can take a picture of it and ask Siri what it’s called and where to find it. You won’t need a ChatGPT account, but you will need to grant permission for Siri to tap into the service. With Apple Intelligence, Siri will become aware of your personal context, which means it can take actions that are unique to you. Siri will be able to use the information available on your device to find what you’re looking for. For instance, if you can’t remember whether your friend Alice shared a recipe with you in a text or an email, you can ask Siri to “pull up the recipe that Alice sent a few days ago.” Or, if you quickly need to find your passport number when booking a flight, you can ask Siri to pull it from your email or your images to automatically enter it into a required field. Apple is making it easier for people to communicate with Siri: The assistant is now equipped to better understand natural language. Even if you stumble on your words when talking to Siri, the assistant will still be able to understand you. You can say, for instance, “Siri, set an alarm for, oh wait no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that five.” Siri will understand what you’re asking. Plus, you can ask Siri follow-up questions without having to repeat context. For example, if you ask Siri where your next family reunion is going to take place, it will respond with a location. You can then follow-up by asking, “What will the weather be like there?” without having to mention the name of the location. Up until now, you could only communicate with Siri via your voice. With Apple Intelligence, you can type to Siri when you don’t want to speak out loud. You just need to double tap the button on your iPhone or iPad screen to ask Siri any question. The option to type to Siri is handy when you’re in a quiet environment and can’t speak out loud. Or, perhaps you’re in a loud environment; typing to Siri can ensure your inquiry is understood clearly. Siri now has more information about Apple’s products and services, so if you have a question about your Apple device, you can ask Siri for help. That includes how to use a feature for the first time on your iPhone, iPad and Mac. For instance, you can ask Siri how to schedule a text message to send later. Siri will then give you step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Otherwise you’d have to to go into your settings and navigate to a help page if you needed more information about your device. Siri can now understand what’s on your screen and take action based on what you’re currently looking at on your device. For instance, if your friend texts you a new address, you can tell Siri to add the address to their contact card. Or, if your friend suggests a TV show on Apple TV+, you can ask Siri to open it. With Apple Intelligence, Siri can take action in and across apps. You can ask Siri toenhance a photo for you in the Photos appand then ask the digital assistant to send it to a specific person in Messages. You don’t have to open the separate apps or complete the tasks, as Siri will be able to take action in both apps on its own. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Apple,"What is Apple Intelligence, when is it coming and who will get it?",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/what-is-apple-intelligence-when-is-coming-and-who-will-get-it/,"3:34 AM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment After months of speculation,Apple Intelligencetook center stage atWWDC 2024 in June. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze. Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category. Apple Intelligence (yes, AI for short) isn’t a standalone feature. Rather, it’s about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps. We’ll learn more during the company’s iPhone 16 event,which starts at 10 a.m. Monday. In addition to new iPhones,we also expect to see updates to the Apple Watch, AirPods and maybe even some new Macs. Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms includingChatGPTandGoogle Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music. The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts. Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence togenerate custom emojis (Genmojis)in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is astandalone image generation appthat utilizes prompts to create visual content than can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media. Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaitedface-lift for Siri.The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple’s operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it’s doing its thing. More important,new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It’s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you’re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer. It’s too early to speak to the efficacy of any of the above features. While thelatest batch of Apple operating systemshit public beta this week, Apple Intelligence isn’t yet fully baked. It’s clear, however, that Apple was pressed to talk it up in June both to bely concern that it didn’t have a generative AI plan and to offer a head start for developers. While we saw demos at WWDC, we’re going to have towait until the fallto get our hands on a beta of Apple Intelligence. As it happens, fall is also when the public versions of iOS/iPadOS 18 and Mac Sequoia will hit the App Store. The offering will be free to use, so long as you haveone of the following pieces of hardware: Notably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model’s chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives. Apple has taken asmall-model, bespoke approach to training. Rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device. That doesn’t apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error. A lot was made about Apple’s pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of WWDC. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it’s not really built for. It’s a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitation. Apple Intelligence is free. So, too,is access to ChatGPT. However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don’t. This will, presumably, be a big driver to the already thriving generative AI platform. We know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said thatGoogle Gemini is next on that list. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Security,"For security, we have to stop picking up the phone",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/07/for-security-we-have-to-stop-picking-up-the-phone/,"6:00 AM PDT • September 7, 2024","Comment How do you know that the person on the other end of a phone call is really who they say they are? Earlier in July, a Ferrari executive was flooded with a barrage of WhatsApp messages that appeared to come from his boss, the carmaker’s CEO, Benedetto Vigna. But the Ferrari executive didn’t recognize the number, and he couldn’t be sure it was really his boss. Suspicious of the flurry of messages from the unknown number, the Ferrari executive still took a call with the person who claimed to be Vigna. Despite the fact that the purported CEO had Vigna’s southern Italian accent, the executive still felt something was off, so he asked the caller something only Vigna would know, something the two personally discussed days earlier. “Sorry, Benedetto, but I need to identify you,” the executive said. And then the call abruptly ended,and a potentially colossal fraud was avoided, as reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. If you think the Ferrari executive is a rare edge case for scammers, think again. For as long as we’ve had telephones, there have been people trying to trick someone into thinking they’re someone else. Now, as with the case of the attempt against Ferrari, voice AI tools make it so that scammers can clone someone’s voice and trick victims into thinking they’re talking to another person. All of these attacks involve the phone, or rather, picking up a phone call. Once you pick up the call, scammers and fraudsters can use tactics designed to pressure and force you into acting quickly and hastily in a high-stress situation. You’ve probably heard of some of these scams already. Look, the police (or the feds)are not going to call you to claimthat “you have a warrant out for your arrest” or to demand a payment to invalidate the warrant. If there is an arrest warrant out for you, the police won’t leave you a threatening voicemail; they will come to your house. It’s unlikely that your healthcare provider will call you to demand payment over the phone without first sending you a letter or a paper bill. The FBI says that healthcare fraudcan affect anyoneand ranges fromscammers impersonating healthcare providersto fraudulent claims that you owe a balance on a nonexistent bill. And, yes, you actually should be wary of the person on the other end of a phone call who claims to be from your bank, or from your workplace, or from an online tech company calling you to “verify your personal information,” or asking you to hand overa security code that was sent to your phone. The alternative is to stop picking up the phone. Wait, identify, then respond. Some scams are more advanced than others, including the spoofing of phone numbers that appear as genuine on caller ID and using AI tools to manipulate a person’s voice; this is sometimes referred to as a “deepfake.” Often the scammer will try to evoke a response or reaction by pretending to be a close family member in distress. Even if you think you know the person who’s calling you, but you cannot be completely sure, this may be for a good reason. Trust your instinct, be vigilant. Take the case of Ferrari’s near miss. On the call, the Ferrari executive asked the purported CEO a question that only the real boss would know, the title of the book the two talked about a few days earlier. On a smaller scale, some friends and families have agreed-upon safe words or phrases that they can use in the event they need to prove that it’s really them. (Going one step further, having an alternative phrase used only if the victim is speaking under duress can help notify others of an unsafe or dangerous situation.) If someone calls you seemingly out of the blue to ask for your information, how can you know that the person calling you is in fact legitimate? You may only have the caller’s phone number to rely on, and you may not recognize the digits. If your bank claims to call you, call the number on your bank card to verify for yourself. If a company or organization you might recognize calls you and asks for information that arouses your suspicions, hang up the call, go to the organization’s website or official app, and call them back directly. Don’t just rely on Google search for a phone number, since scammers cantrick search enginesinto displaying false customer service phone numbers run by the scammers. If you get a phone call claiming that someone has logged into one of your online accounts, go to the website or app for your online account andverify for yourselfbefore you take any further action. Most companies, such as Google or Facebook, do not call you but rather rely on their official customer support portals. Be like that Ferrari executive. Take a minute to breathe and think, and take control of the situation. And next time your phone alerts you to an incoming call, maybe just let it go to voicemail. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Security,Transport for London outages drag into weekend after cyberattack,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/transport-for-london-outages-drag-into-weekend-after-cyberattack/,"8:05 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Transport for London, the government body overseeing the U.K. capital’s public transit system, said it is experiencing online outages due to an “ongoing cyber security incident” set to drag into the weekend. TfL, which runs the London Underground (known as the Tube), buses and trams across London, said that while the city’s public transit system is “operating as usual,” several customer-facing systems are offline, including some ticketing systems and its online real-time Tube arrival information. Details of the incident remain scarce. TfL disclosed the cyberattack on September 2, and said that it took action to “prevent further access to its systems.” In abrief update on its websiteon Friday, TfL said it has no evidence yet that any customer data was compromised in the cyberattack. TfL spokesperson Princess Mills declined to answer TechCrunch’s specific questions about the incident, including what evidence, such as logs, the organization has to determine if any data was stolen. TfL also declined to make the executive who oversees cybersecurity available for an interview. In a brief statement attributed to TfL’s chief technology officer Shashi Verma, the transport network confirmed it “identified some suspicious activity on Sunday and took action to limit access.” According to the cyber incident page as of Friday, TfL says, “many of our staff have limited access to systems and email and, as a result, we may be delayed or unable to respond to your query or any webforms previously submitted.” According tosources speaking to BBC News, TfL employees have been told to work from home, as much of the organization’s back-office systems at its headquarters are affected. A review by TechCrunch of TfL’s public-facing web infrastructure shows much of the organization’s systems are no longer online, or have been restricted from accessing the public internet, likely in an effort to isolate the intruders and prevent further access. At the time of writing, TechCrunch found several TfL systems, including its employee log-on portal, were still accessible from the internet. Updated with post-publish comment from TfL.

Security,US charges five Russian military hackers with targeting Ukraine’s government with destructive malware,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/us-charges-five-russian-military-hackers-with-targeting-ukraines-government-with-destructive-malware/,"11:56 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice accused five members of Russia’s military intelligence agency of hacking several Ukrainian government agencies, an unnamed U.S. government agency in Maryland and computers belonging to 26 NATO countries, among other victims. The DOJannounced the indictmentof the five members of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate, also known as GRU, and in particular its hacking Unit 29155. The indictment names Russian GRU colonel and commanding officer of cyber operations, Yuriy Denisov; lieutenants Vladislav Borovkov, Denis Denisenko, Dmitriy Goloshubov and Nikolay Korchagin; and a civilian co-conspirator, Amin Stigal, who waspreviously indicted for some of the same crimes. Prosecutors allege that the six indicted individuals were behindthe WhisperGate cyberattack, an operation that was designed to appear like a ransomware attack on the Ukrainian government, but was actually a destructive attack that would make the targeted computers unusable. The Russian governmenthas been accusedof launching WhisperGate in support of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. According to the indictment, Denisov, Denisenko, Korchagin, Goloshubov and Borovkov, and other unnamed individuals, planned meetings at Cafe Shokoladnitsa in the Sofia Shopping Center in Moscow. The indictment does not explain how the U.S. government was able to get information about these meetings, nor the pictures of the suspects, but it suggests the authorities gained significant access to the hackers’ infrastructure. “The message is clear. To the GRU and to the Russians: We are onto you, we penetrated your systems. The FBI, the Department of Justice will be relentless in pursuing you, so you better pay attention to the fact that we have gotten to you, and we are in your systems,” Matt Olsen, the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said during a press conference announcing the indictments. The indictment included details about the six Russians’ cyber operations, as well as a group picture of four of the lieutenants, and one of general Denisov. The six Russians are accused of hacking several government and civilian targets in Ukraine over the last couple of years, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, State Treasury, Judiciary Administration, several other government departments and the state-owned Ukrainian railways. Around October 2022, the six allegedly hacked what the indictment only described as the transportation infrastructure of “a Central European Country.”As previously reported, the timing of this attack suggests it wasthe cyberattack against Denmark, which caused delays and outages across the country’s train network, according to the indictment. During a press conference, U.S. government representatives declined to specify which U.S. agency based in Maryland was allegedly targeted by the Russian hackers. Also on Thursday, the FBI, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA, the U.K’s National Cyber Security Centre, as well as European, Canadian and Australian government agencies,released a joint cybersecurity advisorywith technical details of Unit 29155’s operations. The FBI, which dubbed the international effort against the six alleged Russian hackers as Operation Toy Soldier, alsopublished a poster with the hackers’ picturessoliciting tips that could lead to their arrest, and offered a reward of $10 million for each alleged hacker. In a poston the official X accountfor the Rewards for Justice bug bounty program following the indictments, the U.S. government referred to the hackers as having “baby faces.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Security,X is hiring staff for security and safety after two years of layoffs,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/x-is-hiring-staff-for-security-and-safety-after-two-years-of-layoffs/,"12:35 PM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment Nearlytwo yearsafter the layoffs across X’s trust, safety and security teams, Elon Musk’s social media company is now trying to hire new employees to help moderate content and secure its platform, according to X’sofficial job listings. In the last month, X posted two dozen job openings evenly split across itssafetyandcybersecurity teams. The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist. These are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his$44 billion acquisitionof the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023,Musk told the BBCthat Twitter, as it was known then, reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers in six months, leaving the company’s workforce at around 1,500 employees when layoffs were completed. Those cuts had included significant reductions for the company’s trust and safety team. In January this year, following an inquiry from Australia’s online safety commissioner, X said that it had laid off 80% of its trust and safety staff since Musk’s takeover. X also said in its responses that before Musk’s acquisition, the company had 279 engineers on its trust and safety teams around the world, which were cut down to 55 by the end of May 2023. Overall, X said it reduced its 4,062-strong trust and safety team by almost a third to 2,849 employees; its full-time content moderation team from 107 to 51 employees; and its contracted moderators from 2,613 to 2,305 employees,according to the Australian eSafety Commissioner’s report at the time. The recent job listings appear to confirm that X is trying to further beef up its safety teamfollowing the company’s announcement in Januarythat it would create a new Trust and Safety center in Austin, Texas, which will include 100 full-time content moderators. Nine of the two-dozen jobs posted in the last month mention Austin among the possible locations, though the postings also include other cities, like New York City and Palo Alto, California, plus international offices like Manila in the Philippines and Delhi in India. When TechCrunch asked X’s press team a series of questions about these new hires, including the size of the company’s safety and cybersecurity teams, the company responded with an automated message: “Busy now, please check back later.” Departure’s in X’s trust and safety and cybersecurity teams have not been limited to its staff, but also included senior leadership. Since Musk took over, both the company’s chief cybersecurity officerLea Kissnerand the company’s trust and safety leadElla Irwinhave left. The reduction in staff on the trust and safety and cybersecurity teams appear to have hurt X’s ability to secure itself and its users, as well as deal with complex content moderation issues all over the world. On Friday, the Supreme Court in Brazilessentially banned Xacross the country after Musk refused to remove accounts spreading misinformation. Since taking over as Twitter’s owner, Musk himself has been accused of spreading hateful content and misinformation. On Tuesday,Musk promoted a podcast episodefeaturing a guestaccused of engaging in Holocaust denialism. Also this week, Muskposted on Xseveral images from an AI generator showing someone that looks vaguely like Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a beret with the Communist hammer-and-sickle. On the cybersecurity side, Musk hosted an X Spaces event with former President Donald Trump, whichcrashed and was delayed. Musk blamed the crash — without providing evidence — on “a massive [distributed denial-of-service] attack on X.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Security,Halliburton confirms data was stolen in ongoing cyberattack,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/03/halliburton-confirms-data-was-stolen-in-ongoing-cyberattack/,"5:46 AM PDT • September 3, 2024","Comment Energy giant Halliburton has confirmed its systems were hacked and that intruders “accessed and exfiltrated information” following a cyberattack last week. Ina brief filingwith government regulators on Tuesday, Halliburton said it was “evaluating the nature and scope of the [stolen] information,” and what data breach notifications it is required to make. Halliburton last week said it took some of its systems offline following the detection of thecyberattack. The company now says it is “working to identify effects of the incident” on its ongoing oil and fracking operations. When contacted on Tuesday, Halliburton spokesperson Amina Rivera did not comment or say if the company knows what kinds of data were stolen. “We are not commenting beyond what was included in our filing,” said Rivera. Halliburton says its “ongoing investigation and response” includes the restoration of its systems and the “assessment of impacted data.” Much of the company’s public-facing systems remain offline at the time of writing, TechCrunch has found. The oil and fracking giant — one of the world’s largest energy companies — has close to 48,000 employees in dozens of countries, according to its most recent public filings. Halliburton remains largely synonymous with the explosion and oil spill caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (pictured). Halliburton subsequentlyagreed to plead guiltyand settle U.S. government charges for $1.1 billion. Halliburton has said little else about the ongoing cyberattack. When asked, Halliburton spokesperson Rivera did not dispute the incident was linked to ransomware. TechCrunch has seen a copy of a ransom note purportedly related to the Halliburton incident that claims to have encrypted and stolen the company’s files. The note says a ransomware gang known as RansomHub is taking credit for the cyberattack. RansomHub’s dark web leak site, which the gang uses to publish stolen files to extort its victims into paying a ransom, has not yet listed Halliburton as one of its victims. It’s not uncommon for ransomware and extortion gangs topublish the name of its victims when negotiations fall through. A representative for RansomHub, when reached by TechCrunch, did not comment on the Halliburton hack. According toa recent U.S. government assessmentof the ransomware gang, RansomHub has claimed more than 210 victims since its inception in February 2024. The gang is also linked to the cyberattack atU.S. health tech giant Change Healthcare. Halliburton said it has and will continue to incur expenses related to the cyberattack. Halliburton made $23 billion in revenue during 2023, and its chief executive Jeff Miller made $19 million in total executive compensation during the year. Halliburton would not say who presently oversees cybersecurity at the company, and would not make them available for an interview. Do you know more about the Halliburton incident?

AI,Apple Intelligence delays could impede iPhone 16 ‘supercycle’,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-intelligence-delays-could-impede-iphone-16-supercycle/,"12:25 PM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment When Apple unveiled itsAI plans at WWDC in June, analystssuggestedthe feature could put the iPhone 16 on track for another “supercycle.” Like the addition of5Gbefore it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence’s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device. We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s“It’s Glowtime”event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it’s believed that Apple Intelligence’s slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential. In June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience.Trained on small models— instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — Apple’s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI. AsBloomberg notestoday, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16’s bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we’reunlikely to seemany delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China — the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch. In the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there’s still a lot of catching up to do. At the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow’s event is set to change that, especially asfurther rumorspoint to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros. While sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company’s bottom line than a staggered rollout.

AI,Elon Musk says Tesla has ‘no need’ to license xAI models,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-no-need-to-license-xai-models/,"10:41 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Elon Musk has denied a report that one of his companies, Tesla, has discussed sharing revenue with another of his companies, xAI, so that it can use the startup’s AI models. The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterdaythat under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus. Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter),Musk saidhe hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.” “Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.” Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left).TechCrunch reported earlier this yearthat as part of the pitch forxAI’s $6 billion funding round, the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies. Tesla shareholders have sued Muskover the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company. Powered byWordPress VIP"
AI,Meta Llama: Everything you need to know about the open generative AI model,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/meta-llama-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-open-generative-ai-model/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Like every big tech company these days, Meta has its own flagship generative AI model, calledLlama. Llama is somewhat unique among major models in that it’s “open,” meaning developers can download and use it however they please (with certain limitations). That’s in contrast to models like Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’sGPT-4o(which powersChatGPT) andGoogle’s Gemini, which can only be accessed via APIs. In the interest of giving developers choice, however, Meta has also partnered with vendors including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to make cloud-hosted versions of Llama available. In addition, the company has released tools designed to make it easier to fine-tune and customize the model. Here’s everything you need to know about Llama, from its capabilities and editions to where you can use it. We’ll keep this post updated as Meta releases upgrades and introduces new dev tools to support the model’s use. Llama is a family of models — not just one: The latest versions areLlama 3.1 8B,Llama 3.1 70BandLlama 3.1 405B, which was releasedin July 2024. They’re trained on web pages in a variety of languages, public code and files on the web, as well as synthetic data (i.e. data generated by other AI models). Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are small, compact models meant to run on devices ranging from laptops to servers. Llama 3.1 405B, on the other hand, is a large-scale model requiring (absent some modifications) data center hardware. Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are less capable than Llama 3.1 405B, but faster. They’re “distilled” versions of 405B, in point of fact, optimized for low storage overhead and latency. All the Llama models have 128,000-token context windows. (In data science, tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”) A model’s context, or context window, refers to input data (e.g. text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g. additional text). Long context can prevent models from “forgetting” the content of recent docs and data, and from veering off topic and extrapolating wrongly. Those 128,000 tokens translate to around 100,000 words or 300 pages, which for reference is around the length of “Wuthering Heights,” “Gulliver’s Travels” and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Like other generative AI models, Llama can perform a range of different assistive tasks, like coding and answering basic math questions, as well as summarizing documents in eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish and Thai). Most text-based workloads — think analyzing files like PDFs and spreadsheets — are within its purview; none of the Llama models can process or generate images, although that maychangein the near future. All the latest Llama models can be configured to leverage third-party apps, tools and APIs to complete tasks. They’re trained out of the box to use Brave Search to answer questions about recent events, the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries and a Python interpreter for validating code. In addition, Meta says the Llama 3.1 models can use certain tools they haven’t seen before (but whether they canreliablyuse those tools is another matter). If you’re looking to simply chat with Llama, it’spowering the Meta AI chatbot experienceon Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus and Meta.ai. Developers building with Llama can download, use or fine-tune the model across most of the popular cloud platforms. Meta claims it has over 25 partners hosting Llama, including Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell and Snowflake. Some of these partners have built additional tools and services on top of Llama, including tools that let the models reference proprietary data and enable them to run at lower latencies. Meta suggests using its smaller models, Llama 8B and Llama 70B, for general-purpose applications like powering chatbots and generating code. Llama 405B, the company says, is better reserved for model distillation — the process of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller, more efficient model — and generating synthetic data to train (or fine-tune) alternative models. Importantly, the Llama licenseconstrains how developers can deploy the model: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion. Alongside Llama, Meta provides tools intended to make the model “safer” to use: Llama Guard tries to detect potentially problematic content either fed into — or generated — by a Llama model, including content relating to criminal activity, child exploitation, copyright violations, hate, self-harm and sexual abuse. Developers cancustomizethe categories of blocked content, and apply the blocks to all the languages Llama supports out of the box. Like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard can block text intended for Llama, but only text meant to “attack” the model and get it to behave in undesirable ways. Meta claims that Llama Guard can defend against explicitly malicious prompts (i.e. jailbreaks that attempt to get around Llama’s built-in safety filters) in addition to prompts that contain “injected inputs.” As for CyberSecEval, it’s less a tool than a collection of benchmarks to measure model security. CyberSecEval can assess the risk a Llama model poses (at least according to Meta’s criteria) to app developers and end users in areas like “automated social engineering” and “scaling offensive cyber operations.” Llama comes with certain risks and limitations, like all generative AI models. For instance, it’s unclear whether Meta trained Llama on copyrighted content. If it did, users might be liable for infringement if they end up unwittingly using acopyrighted snippet that the model regurgitated. Meta at one pointused copyrighted e-books for AI trainingdespite its own lawyers’ warnings, according to recent reporting by Reuters. The company controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts, photos and captions, andmakes it difficult for users to opt out. What’s more, Meta, along with OpenAI, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, over the companies’ alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for model training. Programming is another area where it’s wise to tread lightly when using Llama. That’s because Llama might — like its generative AI counterparts —produce buggy or insecure code. As always, it’s best to have a human expert review any AI-generated code before incorporating it into a service or software. Powered byWordPress VIP"
AI,"Apple Event 2024: iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence and all the other expected ‘Glowtime’ reveals",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-event-2024-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-and-all-the-other-expected-glowtime-reveals/,"7:26 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Update 9/8:As ever, additional rumors have popped up in the days leading up to the event. Among the more interesting of recent vintage (all Apple Watch related): The Apple Watch Series 10’s blood pressure monitoring isnotcomingto the Watch Ultra 2, limited Apple Intelligence features for the Watch, though it will be baked into afuture fitness coach-style feature. Both models are reportedly getting that sleep apnea feature, though itlikely won’t be available at launch. Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at itsSeptember 9“It’s Glowtime”event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays. The livestream kicks off onMonday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most. Back at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name —Apple Intelligence— which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The “small model” method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it’s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience. That’s a marked difference between it and much larger “black box” models like OpenAI’s andGoogle’s Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence’s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as — at the very least — all of generative AI is, at the end of the day. The answer for how this all ties into “Glowtime” can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced amuch-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing. Out of every iPhone ever launched,two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that’s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro’s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter. With all of this in mind, next week’s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line. We’re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what’s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you’re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out. That will reportedly bump the Pro Max’s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device’s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches. Camera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunchis a new glass molded lensthat is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don’t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart. Leakeddummy modelsfrom early in the year give us a rough idea of each model’s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new “Capture” button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities. The most welcome change, however, may bebigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additionalreports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks. The Pro models are alsoexpected to gainWi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard. As hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it’d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor — something especially important when discussing a watch. Like the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor — the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn’t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but asBloomberg notes, Apple’slegal woes with Masimomay well trip up that feature. A long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week. Stay with me onthis one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its productsto comply with EU mandates. So, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We’ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we’re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however,finallyget the over-earAirPods Max 2,four years after the original. This one is a big maybe.Recent reportingsuggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac’s release calendar ever since the pandemic.

AI,How a viral AI image catapulted a Mexican startup to a major adidas contract,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/07/how-a-viral-ai-image-catapulted-a-mexican-startup-to-a-major-adidas-contract/,"5:00 AM PDT • September 7, 2024","Comment Antonio Nuño, Fatima Alvarez, and Enrique Rodriguez have been friends since they were five years old. As teenagers, they became volunteers helping indigenous communities — first in Mexico, then in other countries — and saw that many of the women were artisans. The trio came to realize that these artists “made very beautiful things in a very sustainable way,” Nuño recalls, and by the time they were 25, the idea for a business had germinated. They imagined connecting these artists, “their techniques and their stories with the supply chains of global companies looking for more sustainable ways to create products.” So in 2016,Someone Somewherewas born. Today the Mexico City-based startup works with hundreds of rural artisans in seven of Mexico’s poorest states to apply traditional handcrafts on clothing and accessories, with the mission of creating “quality, on-trend products.” The startup helps artisan groups organize as cooperatives or small businesses, formalize, access a bank account, and build communitary savings accounts. The artisans are paid for each product they make. Someone Somewhere supplies the materials, and pays 50% in advance and 50% once they finish each product. In its first few years, Someone Somewhere landed contracts with some larger companies such as Ben & Frank (the Warby Parker of Latin America) and Rappi. But in 2023, the trio realized they could use AI — particularly Stable Diffusion’s text to images model — to help the company scale even further. They fed their databases of all the various materials and techniques the artisans used intoStable Diffusion’s modeland began designing AI-assisted concepts, produced as images, of well-known products. The idea was to “show companies how some of their most iconic items could look if they were made with artisans from different regions.” They posted the concepts on sites like LinkedIn, tagging the companies. For example, they created images for Red Bull and Trader Joe’s. But it was when they posted their concept of an adidas-branded Mexican National Team soccer jersey on LinkedIn in March that changed their business forever.That postwent viral, ultimately receiving more than 1 million views, with people tagging adidas employees for visibility. In the post, Nuño estimated that each shirt would “generate six months of fair work for more than 3,000 artisans” and “allow more than 15,000 people, including families, to break the cycle of poverty.” He wrote: “We can imagine what would happen if Mexico’s next jersey was made in collaboration withSomeone Somewhere, and incorporated elements hand-embroidered by various communities in the country. It would be the first time that a national team launches such an initiative, and it would undoubtedly inspire dozens of other countries to replicate it since crafts are the second largest source of employment in all of Latin America, Africa and Asia.” Just one day after the post went up, Nuño says that adidas reached out and asked for a meeting. Within weeks, his company had an agreement to launch a physical product made available to adiClub members, as well as to Mexican soccer players and content creators. All told, the marketing post reached more than 50 million people, and was covered on national TV and over 100 media outlets, according to Nuño. On June 21, the companies announced the new collection of Mexican National Team jerseys, hand-embroidered by women artisans from the Sierra Norte of Puebla, Mexico. Each shirt represented more than 11 hours of hand-embroidery work, symbolically representing the 11 players who proudly represented Mexico in the Copa América. “Through these jerseys, both adidas and Someone Somewhere seek to honor the work of Mexican artisans and continue embracing the cultural heritage of the country, both its roots and the seeds it leaves for future creative generations,” said Pablo Cavallaro, senior director, Brand Activation at adidas, in a statement. “This collection is inspired by the communities where the artisans create each of their pieces, the space they call ‘home’.” The shirts available to the public include Someone Somewhere’s signature detail: a QR code so that the user/purchaser can learn more about the artisan who helped create it. “Now we are working on more things with adidas that we will launch next year,” Nuño said. Nuño credits advances in AI for his startup’s recent growth. “We found that creating products with AI shows companies the potential so it’s easier to move forward,” Nuño told TechCrunch. “It has allowed us to develop partnerships with a lot of companies, based in the U.S. mostly,” The strategy is working so well that Someone Somewhere went from designing 10 products a month to 5,000. “This has helped us accelerate, and it’s an amazing way of showing that AI can take away jobs but also create them, if used creatively,” he added. “Just in the last 12 months alone, we’ve made more than 10 million products with this model.” Meanwhile, Someone Somewhere’s revenue has grown 36x in the last three years. This year, the 75-person team is working with triple the number of brands than it did last year, in large part thanks to the use of AI to co-create products. The Stable Diffusion model that Someone Somewhere is using came out last year and allows users to fine-tune the concept images it creates. “You can control the silhouettes of products,” Nuño said, adding that this allows his startup to experiment with fabrics and embroideries when developing a concept product. “Before our main bottleneck was showing companies the potential of what we could do together. We had to make physical products, which takes a lot of time. This technology opens doors — they say an image is more than a thousand words. Now we’re able to connect with these big brands and that makes the conversation go way faster,” he said. That’s led Someone Somewhere to deals like a co-branded sustainable accessories line with Gator Cases, and with companies such as Google, Uber, Stripe and Amazon (among others) to make merchandise for their employees, events and marketing campaigns. AI is not the only thing responsible for Someone Somewhere’s growth. The company also accidentally landed a deal, through its use of those QR codes, that placed some of its products in Apple stores worldwide and online. The products are made through a partnership with a company called Nimble, which makes sustainable electronic accessories. Someone Somewhere sells its products to Nimble, which in turn sells it to Apple. Nimble CEO and co-founder Ross Howe is aDelta Onebusiness class customer, and on a flight last year the airline gave him an amenity kit made by Someone Somewhere. “The items were neatly packed in this fabric bag, which immediately caught my attention,” he recounts. “It was very high-quality, and had a QR code to meet the artisan who made it. By the time the plane landed, I learned everything I could about the company behind it, and wanted to explore an opportunity to work with them.” Nimble already had some concepts for new products that included a carrying case but “just needed the right partner to help create it,” Howe said. “Aside from their apparent design capabilities, Someone Somewhere’s mission and status as a fellow Certified B Corp checked so many boxes for what we look for in a partner.” So the company reached out to learn more. Today, its new Apple-exclusive collection features a series of PowerKnit Travel Kits with USB-C charging cables. Each includes a travel case made in collaboration with Someone Somewhere. The pouches are being sold in Apple stores in 30 countries, including the U.S. and most of Europe. “After years of researching potential companies to collaborate on this type of project, we hadn’t come across anything quite like what Someone Somewhere is doing,” Howe said. “We are exploring additional projects for potential future release.” All of this growth has come after raising a total of just $1.7 million in funding from investors such as Dila Capital, GBM Ventures, Kalei Ventures, Louis Jordan, Soldiers Field Angels, and Unreasonable Capital, so far. Someone Somewhere has been profitable since 2022, and is in the process of raising a new round “to take advantage of the nearshoring and sustainable procurement trends that are clearly growing,” Nuño said.

Apps,Bending Spoons plans to lay off 75% of WeTransfer staff after acquisition,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/,"9:24 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Italy-based app company Bending Spoons, which owns Evernote and Meetup, is planning to lay off 75% of the staff of file transfer service WeTransfer, TechCrunch has learned. Bending Spoonsacquired the Dutch company in July for an undisclosed amount. The company confirmed the plans for the WeTransfer layoff to TechCrunch. The staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding lay offs. Dutch media reported thatWeTransfer has over 350 employees. Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari said that typically, the company studies the organization that it is acquiring and determines what is the best vision of the business going forward with an aim to operate it forever. “Once the vision is clear, we try to close the gap between the status quo and the vision as quickly and as fully as we can. Typically, doing so involves making major changes to many areas, including the organization. While we don’t enjoy making painful or unpopular decisions, we’re prepared to do so when we believe it’s the right thing to do to help the business thrive,” he said. Ferrari also noted that in WeTransfer’s case, Bending Spoons wanted to have a small and focused team. “In this particular case, the vision we developed is of a smaller, more sharply focused WeTransfer organization, which we believe will be better-positioned to serve WeTransfer’s success with a long-term view,” the CEO said. Since its acquisition, WeTransfer has rolled outa new feature to let users extend the expiry date of a link on the app. However, Bending Spoons or WeTransfer hasn’t disclosed their plans about long-term product roadmap. The layoffs are not surprising as Bending Spoons regularly cuts the employee count of companies it acquires in order to operate them profitably. In February 2023, it cut 129 employees fromEvernote’s staff. In December 2023, the company let go of the entire workforce of Filmic,the popular photo and video editing app that it acquired in 2022. Earlier this year, Meetup alsofaced job cuts after its acquisition. In February, Bending Spoons raised$155 million in equity financingfrom new investor Durable Capital Partners and existing ones, including Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, NB Renaissance, NUO Capital, and StarTIP (controlled by Tamburi Investment Partners).

Apps,Meta Llama: Everything you need to know about the open generative AI model,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/meta-llama-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-open-generative-ai-model/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Like every big tech company these days, Meta has its own flagship generative AI model, calledLlama. Llama is somewhat unique among major models in that it’s “open,” meaning developers can download and use it however they please (with certain limitations). That’s in contrast to models like Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’sGPT-4o(which powersChatGPT) andGoogle’s Gemini, which can only be accessed via APIs. In the interest of giving developers choice, however, Meta has also partnered with vendors including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to make cloud-hosted versions of Llama available. In addition, the company has released tools designed to make it easier to fine-tune and customize the model. Here’s everything you need to know about Llama, from its capabilities and editions to where you can use it. We’ll keep this post updated as Meta releases upgrades and introduces new dev tools to support the model’s use. Llama is a family of models — not just one: The latest versions areLlama 3.1 8B,Llama 3.1 70BandLlama 3.1 405B, which was releasedin July 2024. They’re trained on web pages in a variety of languages, public code and files on the web, as well as synthetic data (i.e. data generated by other AI models). Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are small, compact models meant to run on devices ranging from laptops to servers. Llama 3.1 405B, on the other hand, is a large-scale model requiring (absent some modifications) data center hardware. Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are less capable than Llama 3.1 405B, but faster. They’re “distilled” versions of 405B, in point of fact, optimized for low storage overhead and latency. All the Llama models have 128,000-token context windows. (In data science, tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”) A model’s context, or context window, refers to input data (e.g. text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g. additional text). Long context can prevent models from “forgetting” the content of recent docs and data, and from veering off topic and extrapolating wrongly. Those 128,000 tokens translate to around 100,000 words or 300 pages, which for reference is around the length of “Wuthering Heights,” “Gulliver’s Travels” and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Like other generative AI models, Llama can perform a range of different assistive tasks, like coding and answering basic math questions, as well as summarizing documents in eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish and Thai). Most text-based workloads — think analyzing files like PDFs and spreadsheets — are within its purview; none of the Llama models can process or generate images, although that maychangein the near future. All the latest Llama models can be configured to leverage third-party apps, tools and APIs to complete tasks. They’re trained out of the box to use Brave Search to answer questions about recent events, the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries and a Python interpreter for validating code. In addition, Meta says the Llama 3.1 models can use certain tools they haven’t seen before (but whether they canreliablyuse those tools is another matter). If you’re looking to simply chat with Llama, it’spowering the Meta AI chatbot experienceon Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus and Meta.ai. Developers building with Llama can download, use or fine-tune the model across most of the popular cloud platforms. Meta claims it has over 25 partners hosting Llama, including Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell and Snowflake. Some of these partners have built additional tools and services on top of Llama, including tools that let the models reference proprietary data and enable them to run at lower latencies. Meta suggests using its smaller models, Llama 8B and Llama 70B, for general-purpose applications like powering chatbots and generating code. Llama 405B, the company says, is better reserved for model distillation — the process of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller, more efficient model — and generating synthetic data to train (or fine-tune) alternative models. Importantly, the Llama licenseconstrains how developers can deploy the model: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion. Alongside Llama, Meta provides tools intended to make the model “safer” to use: Llama Guard tries to detect potentially problematic content either fed into — or generated — by a Llama model, including content relating to criminal activity, child exploitation, copyright violations, hate, self-harm and sexual abuse. Developers cancustomizethe categories of blocked content, and apply the blocks to all the languages Llama supports out of the box. Like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard can block text intended for Llama, but only text meant to “attack” the model and get it to behave in undesirable ways. Meta claims that Llama Guard can defend against explicitly malicious prompts (i.e. jailbreaks that attempt to get around Llama’s built-in safety filters) in addition to prompts that contain “injected inputs.” As for CyberSecEval, it’s less a tool than a collection of benchmarks to measure model security. CyberSecEval can assess the risk a Llama model poses (at least according to Meta’s criteria) to app developers and end users in areas like “automated social engineering” and “scaling offensive cyber operations.” Llama comes with certain risks and limitations, like all generative AI models. For instance, it’s unclear whether Meta trained Llama on copyrighted content. If it did, users might be liable for infringement if they end up unwittingly using acopyrighted snippet that the model regurgitated. Meta at one pointused copyrighted e-books for AI trainingdespite its own lawyers’ warnings, according to recent reporting by Reuters. The company controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts, photos and captions, andmakes it difficult for users to opt out. What’s more, Meta, along with OpenAI, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, over the companies’ alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for model training. Programming is another area where it’s wise to tread lightly when using Llama. That’s because Llama might — like its generative AI counterparts —produce buggy or insecure code. As always, it’s best to have a human expert review any AI-generated code before incorporating it into a service or software. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Apps,Meta will let third-party apps place calls to WhatsApp and Messenger users — in 2027,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/meta-will-let-third-party-apps-place-calls-to-whatsapp-and-messenger-users-in-2027/,"10:53 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Meta on Friday published an update on how it plans to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European law that aims to promote competition in digital marketplaces, where the law concerns the company’s messaging apps, Messenger and WhatsApp. As Meta notes in ablog post, the DMA requires that it provide an option in WhatsApp and Messenger to connect with interoperable third-party messaging services and apps. Meta says it’s building notifications into WhatsApp and Messenger to inform users about these third-party integrations and alert them when a newly compatible third-party messaging app comes online. The company also says it’s introducing an onboarding flow in WhatsApp and Messenger where users can learn more about third-party chats and switch them on. From the flow, users will be able to set up a designated folder for third-party messages or, alternatively, opt for a combined inbox. In 2025, Meta will roll out group functionality for third-party chats, and, in 2027, it’ll launch voice and video calling in accordance with the DMA. And at some unspecified point in the future, Meta will bring “rich messaging” features for third-party chats to WhatsApp and Messenger, like reactions, direct replies, typing indicators and read receipts, the company says. “We will keep collaborating with third-party messaging services in order to provide the safest and best experience,” Meta wrote in the post. “Users will start to see the third-party chat option when a third-party messaging service has built, tested and launched the necessary technology to make the feature a positive and secure user experience.” The upcoming WhatsApp and Messenger interoperability features aren’t a slam dunk necessarily. As we’ve reportedpreviously, it’s not clear whether other major messaging operators, such as Viber and Telegram, will support them. WhatsApp will require end-to-end encryption to enable interoperability, which could also present technical roadblocks. Plus, Meta requires that companies sign an agreement — the details of which were only relatively recently made public — to integrate with any of its systems. Open source messaging protocol Matrix’s founder Matthew Hodgson, for one, noted in a talk this year that Matrix will work with WhatsApp, end-to-end encryption intact, “on an experimental basis.” Meta is attempting to meet its obligations under the DMA’s messaging-related clauses, but the company has come under fire for allegedly violating other components of the legislation. This summer, the European Commission said that Meta’s “pay or consent” ad model, which offers EU users of Facebook and Instagram a choice between a paid, ad-free experience or a free, ad-supported version, failed to comply with the DMA.

Apps,"Roblox introduces new earning opportunities for creators, teases generative AI project",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/roblox-introduces-new-earning-opportunities-for-creators-teases-generative-ai-project/,"10:30 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment At the annual Roblox Developers Conference, the company announced on Friday a series of changes coming to the platform in the next few months and years. Most notably, Roblox is adding more ways for creators to earn money through their experiences, and the company is unveiling a project that will power generative AI creation on the platform. The company is introducing a new program that will give creators a higher share of revenue for their paid experiences on the desktop. Creators will now receive 50% of the revenue for paid experiences that cost $9.99, 60% for experiences that cost $29.99 and 70% for experiences that cost $49.99. The change marks a significant increase in revenue sharing, as creators currently earn about 25% of the revenue for their paid experiences. Roblox chief product officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch in an interview that the company believes this change will encourage more traditional game developers to bring their games to the platform. The company also announced that it’s partnering with Shopify to allow creators to sell physical merchandise directly within their experiences. Roblox plans to pilot this integration later this year with select creators, brands and e-commerce partners. To further support creators, Roblox is going to roll out a “Price Optimization” tool that will run tests to help developers identify the best price for in-experience purchases. In some cases, the tool may suggest that developers lower the price of an item to get more sales, benefiting both the developer and players. In the same vein, the company is going to start experimenting with regional pricing recommendations to allow developers to tailor their prices to local markets. In terms of AI, Roblox announced that it’s working on a 3D foundational model that will power generative creation on its platform. The model will be open source and multimodal and allow creators to generate 3D content using text, video and prompts. “A creator could say I want to create a world that is in the Scottish Highlands with castles and a stormy day, with a dragon background, and I want all of this in a steampunk steam style. And then the output will be the full scene creation,” Bronstein said. He noted that generative AI is currently focused on pictures and videos, not 3D creation. But, in Roblox, you need 3D objects, so if you see a tree, it needs to behave like a tree and also be visible from all sides. Bronstein noted that Roblox isn’t trying to replace the creative process but instead focuses on enabling more people to develop and create games. For instance, you may be a great developer but struggle with the artistic requirements for game creation. The 3D foundational model aims to make it easier for anybody to get started on the platform, while also helping current teams speed up the process of game development. Plus, just because you get an output, doesn’t mean that you will implement it right away. Developers will likely fine-tune and modify the AI-generated content, Bronstein said. In addition, Roblox revealed that it’s rolling out a new technology called “Harmony” that will help developers automatically optimize their experiences for different devices and network conditions. While Roblox already has social features that allow users to interact with each other, the company is introducing new ways for users to do so. For starters, it’s adding “Party,” which is a new way for a group of friends to move around Roblox together as a group in a private chat. If a user is under the age of 13, they can chat via text. If a user is older, they can use voice chat. Users in a Party can chat with each other even if they’re playing different games, and if they all want to play the same game, they can send invites to each other. The company is also introducing forums later this year to give users a dedicated space to share feedback, discuss gameplay and report any issues they encounter. To make its platform a destination for people to discover new music, Roblox will roll out a new “What’s Playing” and “Music Charts” feature where people will be able to find trending songs from breakout artists. Roblox is also planning an integration with music distribution service DistroKid to give artists a way to upload and share their music on the platform. All of the features announced today are part of Roblox’s ambitious goal of having 10% of all gaming content revenue worldwide flow through its ecosystem. Although the company didn’t provide a timeline for when it aims to reach this goal, Roblox believes the changes it is introducing will help it achieve the milestone. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Apps,"Instagram jazzes up its DMs with stickers, photo editing, and themes",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/instagram-is-adding-new-photo-editing-features-to-dms/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Meta-owned Instagram is jazzing up the inbox by adding new features for photo editing, sticker creation and themes. The company is trying to make Instagram more appealing as a messaging app with features to make conversations more engaging. While some of these features might not sound new, it’s all about removing friction for users that might prevent them from sending a message. In addition, the inbox — or DMs (direct messages) — are a competitive feature for social apps, including Meta’s Threads, which is taking on Twitter/X. While other startups like Bluesky are integrating DMs directly into their app, Threads is still relying on Instagram’s existing DMs for those who want to connect privately. With today’s release of new features, Instagram users will gain access to a sticker maker in the direct messages interface. Here, you’ll be able to take a photo from the library and use a cutout of an object to create a reaction sticker. Earlier this year, WhatsApp gaineda similar tool for creating stickers. Plus, you can use theiPhone’s own toolto make stickers that you can use across the apps. Instagram will also let you add stickers or draw over a photo before sending it to a friend. These tools were previously available in the Stories composer, so if you wanted to send an image with stickers or scribbles, you had to save that photo and then send it through a DM. Now, you’ll be able to apply these edits directly within the chat interface. Another new feature will allow users to post a note on their own birthday so their friends can wish them a happy birthday. When they tap on the note, they will see a cake effect and confetti animation on the screen. Celebrating birthdays has been a feature that makes Facebook sticky, even after all these years, so making birthday celebrations a bigger part of Instagram could help keep users engaged with the app, despite the growing competition from TikTok and others. Similar to other messaging apps, Instagram will also introduce new themes for chat, such as “Fall” and “Sabrina Carpenter.” Earlier this week, Instagram addeda new feature that lets users comment on Stories, which is also designed to increase engagement.

Events,Real estate revolutions and beanie baby economies,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/real-estate-revolutions-and-beanie-baby-economies/,"7:05 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment TheEquitypodcast crew is wrapping up another eventful week, with real estate, AI agents, gambling and secondary markets — which are, of course, a form of legalized gambling. Mary Ann Azevedo, Becca Szkutak and Devin Coldewey started off this Friday’s episode with the acknowledgment that theX/Twitter bansituation in Brazil is possibly too complicated an issue to even have an opinion on. Let us cook on that for a bit. In the deals of the week, Devin first talked aboutYou.com’s $50 million playto take on more difficult AI tasks, things that can’t be solved with a quick Google search. The company is hoping to be the go-to for complex stuff that mixes live search, coding and natural language understanding — and unlike a lot of its competition, some of its customers actually pay for themselves! Becca, as someone who hazards a buck on a game now and then, is intrigued byDubClub, a startup that claims to systematize and legitimize professional betting handicappers. These are folks who claim to be able to beat the odds, but tend to offer their services by more informal methods. Can DubClub make a clean business out of this popular, but legally fraught, line of work? A nine-figure deal is always worth chatting about, and Mary Ann brings upPaylocity’s acquisition of Airbasefor $325 million — though, as she points out, the real value of the deal is probably even higher. It’s a lot of money, yes, but compared with earlier valuations… no? Somehow we don’t think founder Thejo Kote is shedding too many tears over it. Anyone who’s bought a house or tried knows the sting of the realtor’s fee. How many percent? Well, due to a recent court ruling overturning an established business practice in real estate, percentage fees may be on their way out — if startupLandianhas its way. They want to make flat fees and pay-on-close the standard. Redfin isnot amused! But they aren’t mad either, or so they’d like us to think. Investing in AI is so popular people areinvesting in the investorsinvesting in AI — on the secondary market, where positions on Anthropic, OpenAI and xAI are now commanding a staggering 30% premium. That gives the actual equity holders a lot of leeway, and potentially gives smaller investors a chance to ride the hype train, but it also gives the whole thing the feel of, as Devin put it, “a beanie baby economy.” That reference is just for the millennials as a “thank you” for listening.

Events,"Drip Capital, a fintech that provides working capital to SMBs, picks up $113M",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/drip-capital-a-fintech-that-provides-working-capital-to-smbs-picks-up-113m/,"10:27 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment For over two decades, Jay Chandarana relied on commercial banks to meet the day-to-day, working capital needs of his family business, the sesame seed exporter Dhaval Agri. It was an arrangement that basically worked: The company grew to have a 13% share of the country’s total exports, making it the largest sesame seed exporter in the market. Yet despite sending seeds to customers in 40 countries, it’s still firmly a medium-sized enterprise, with last year’s revenues clearing just $83 million. And it was facing a problem: When Chandarana thought about how he might expand the operation, his bank-based financial arrangement came up short. “Banking in India is collateral-based,” Chandarana explained. “Your volumes may grow according to the business you’re doing, but the bank payments will only increase according to the value of your collateral.” So in 2019, Dhaval Agri decided to try arranging for working capital with Palo Alto-based startupDrip Capitalas an alternative — and it paid off. Chandarana told TechCrunch that Dhaval Agri’s volume has increased 50% in the five years that he’s been a customer of the startup. Now Drip is hoping to scale itself to meet that opportunity with more entrepreneurs in the country and beyond. It has raised $113 million in funding: $23 million in equity from Japanese institutional investors GMO Payment Gateway and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation; and $90 million in debt financing led by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) and East West Bank. The company has raised about $640 million in equity and debt funding so far, with Accel, Peak XV Partners and Y Combinator among its other investors. The debt will be used to expand the number of working-capital loans it provides to SMBs, while the equity will be used for company and product expansion. It uses AI to automate and digitize processes and plans to also use it for risk analysis. Drip currently serves between 9,000 and 10,000 businesses, with around 60% coming from India and the rest from the U.S. and a small amount in Mexico. It is already profitable, and says it is aiming for 40% year-on-year growth in the next two years. The challenge that Dhaval Agri faced is not dissimilar to the capital hurdles that small and medium businesses face globally. SMBs work typically on very short capital turnarounds: They issue invoices to customers to make revenue, but these can take time to get paid, and in the meantime these businesses need to pay suppliers themselves to continue operating. Working capital provided by third parties becomes a common solution. These are essentially short-term loans issued on credit that businesses repay when they themselves get paid (30, 60 and 90 days are common increments), while these businesses need to pay suppliers quickly to maintain sufficient inventory. In India, despite the large proportion of SMBs — it’s been described as thelargest SMB market in the world, approaching 100 million enterprises — traditional financial institutions have not leaned into working capital arrangements designed to encourage growth, just maintenance. Drip Capital addresses all this for thousands of small and medium importers and exporters like Dhaval Agri in India, as well as in the U.S. Its target customer generates annual revenue between $500,000 and $100 million. While itinitially startedwith a focus on businesses doing exports out of India, it gradually expanded to include businesses focused on imports into India before expanding again toserve businesses in the U.S. As with other working-capital startups, Drip advances up to $2.5 million and will essentially buy up their customers’ accounts receivable invoices to the same value (with a servicing commission on top). This allows businesses to have cash to pay their own suppliers and run their businesses, even when their customers take over two months to pay their invoices. Drip also provides account payable financing of up to $5 million aimed at helping importers extend the time they have to pay their suppliers. Drip Capital also recently started serving businesses in domestic trade in the U.S. and plans to expand that model in India. The startup has already applied for a non-banking financial company (NBFC) license to cover the domestic needs of Indian businesses. “The thought process is that for us to basically be able to offer a holistic offering, it is important that we cover the domestic and cross-border needs of the companies we work with,” said Pushkar Mukewar, co-founder and CEO of Drip Capital, in an interview. One of its new products is foreign exchange. Mukewar told TechCrunch that many of Drip Capital’s clients either receive a foreign remittance or send foreign dollars out. The startup targets those clients by offering them cheaper foreign exchange access through its existing partnership with Barclays. Similarly, Drip Capital is piloting a sourcing platform to help connect buyers with new suppliers using its buyer-seller network. This latest investment comes nearly three years after Drip Capitalraised $40 millionin its Series C round in October 2021. “Given that we have achieved profitability, we raised only the amount of equity required for our next phase of growth while watching dilution,” he said. He declined to disclose the valuation but confirmed it was not a down round. “The last two years have been really around making the economics of the business right to get to this point where we are profitable,” he said.

Events,Sedric monitors the communications of employees at financial institutions to ensure compliance,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/sedric-monitors-the-communications-of-employees-at-financial-institutions-to-ensure-compliance/,"4:00 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment For financial institutions, complying with regulations is becoming a costlier proposition. According to a recentpoll, 76% of financial services firms increased their compliance expenditure from 2022 to 2023, with most blamingnewlaws. With the cost of complianceaveragingout to around $10,000 per employee these days, many firms are searching for ways to reduce spending without running afoul of regulators. Entrepreneurs Nir Laznik and Eyal Peleg say that they’ve created a solution — powered by generative AI, as is the trend. Laznik and Peleg co-foundedSedric, an AI-powered platform designed to help financial institutions implement compliance rules and flag possible issues. Prior to Sedric, Laznik spearheaded several startups, including a photo kiosk software firm, while Peleg spent close to eight years at Intel’s AI and machine learning org. “We realized there was disproportionate pressure on mid-size organizations, combined with a new set of challenges for banks,” Laznik said. “We knew the rapid advancements in AI could address these problems in an entirely new way. This convergence of factors led us to create Sedric.” Sedric’s AI acts as an overseer of sorts, monitoring a workforce’s outbound and inbound calls, chats, emails, social media DMs and instant messages. It attempts to flag compliance problems (e.g. omitted disclosures, missed steps and misconduct) as they happen; Sedric can automatically “mitigate” issues and provide coaching to the offending staff in many cases, Laznik claims. “This technology empowers compliance officers with a holistic view of their customer touchpoints across multiple channels, allowing them to flag deviations from established compliance policies and guidelines quickly and efficiently,” Laznik said. “Our platform covers the entire compliance lifecycle, from policy setting to enforcement, correction and audit.” Surveillance that deep might sound a little intrusive — not least of which because Sedric “scores” interactions on a per-employee basis according to adherence to company policies. But, for better or worse, U.S. state and federal guidelines givewide discretionto businesses engaged in monitoring their staff so long as the businesses are reasonably transparent about it. Moreover, some federal-level regulations — particularly regulations pertaining to insider trading, collusion and the sharing of certain earnings documents —mandatethat financial institutions closely track workers in their interactions with customers and the broader marketplace. Thesepreemptstate laws, like New York’s and Connecticut’s, that impose additional requirements on employers conducting workforce monitoring. I asked Laznik about the potential for bias in Sedric’s AI, given that the AI is likely to be monitoring communications of staff from all different backgrounds. Biased AI can lead to discrimination, depending on where and how it’s deployed — whether intentional or not. Studieshave shown that some AI trained to detect toxicity sees phrases in African-American Vernacular English, the informal grammar used by some Black Americans, as disproportionately “toxic.” Other studies havedemonstratedhow speech recognition systems are more likely to wrongly transcribe audio of Black speakers as opposed to their white counterparts. Laznik says that Sedric uses “fine-tuned models” trained on “proprietary datasets curated and validated in collaboration with industry experts” to try to minimize bias. The company also monitors for performance dips in deployed models and retrains models when necessary. “Our platform enables customers to provide direct feedback through various annotation inputs, which are then vetted by compliance teams and are used for re-training or integrated into the prediction process,” he added. “This ensures that our models become increasingly tailored for each customer.” To protect customer — and employee — privacy and security, Sedric allows companies to configure where their data is stored and implement controls that redact (or at least attempt to redact) personally identifiable information. “At Sedric, we’ve designed our platform with compliance and security at its core,” Laznik said. “Enterprises can set their own retention policies and compliance guidelines according to their internal guidelines and specific regulations.” Sedric, which also offers tools to support call center agents as they’re chatting with clients on the phone, has “hundreds” of paying compliance officers and enterprise customers in the U.S. and Europe, Laznik claims. Revenue has increased fivefold over the last year — although Laznik declined to give firmer numbers. “For small- and medium-sized businesses, we offer an off-the-shelf solution, and for enterprises and banks, we offer a hybrid model with tailored customizations,” Laznik said. “Our focus on the specific needs of financial institutions, combined with our proprietary library of pre-trained, regulation-inspired models that can also be customized to each organization’s unique requirements, sets us apart in the market.” Going after finance customers and use cases specifically certainly appears to have worked in Sedric’s favor, setting the company apart from workplace monitoring rivals such as Fairwords, Shield,EruditandAware. It’s a crowded — andoften controversial— market, but investors still sense some opportunity, particularly as AI becomes more deeply embedded in these types of tools. Case in point: Seemingly pleased with Sedric’s progress so far, Foundation Capital led an $18.5 million Series A investment in the four-year-old company that also had participation from Amex Ventures. The new cash will be put toward growing the firm’s go-to-market and R&D teams “significantly” in NYC and Tel Aviv, Laznik said, and brings New York-based Sedric’s total raised to $22 million. Sedric plans to double its headcount in the next 12 months. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Events,Paylocity is acquiring corporate spend startup Airbase for $325M,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/paylocity-acquiring-corporate-spend-startup-airbase-for-325m/,"2:24 PM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment HR and payroll software company Paylocity has agreed to acquire corporate spend startupAirbasefor $325 million, the companies announced Wednesday. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first or second quarter of Paylocity’s fiscal year, which would be sometime in the next 30 to 60 days. It is being funded by borrowings under Paylocity’s revolving credit facility. It’s a decent exit for seven-year-old Airbase, which was founded by Thejo Kote in 2017 to provide software to midsized companies seeking to better manage their spending. Its platform included bill payments, corporate cards, and employee reimbursements, among other things. The San Francisco-based fintech company had raised just over $100 million in equity funding since inception from investors such as Menlo Ventures, Bain Capital and First Round Capital, among others. According to PitchBook, Airbase was valued at $600 million post-money in 2021 at the peak of the market. Headquartered in Schaumburg, Illinois, Paylocity is publicly traded and, according toYahoo Finance, has a current market capitalization of just under $9 billion, with about 40,000 customers. The company in a statement said the addition of Airbase would help it expand its total addressable market beyond human capital management (HCM) and “further into the office of the CFO.” Kote told TechCrunch the decision wasn’t easy but made sense in the end. “Airbase has many years of runway and a clear path to profitability, but I was ultimately convinced by the fantastic opportunity to create a unified HCM and Finance platform for the mid-market — leveraging Paylocity’s size and scale to bring Airbase to a much larger audience.” A source familiar with the deal who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch that the structured deal does not include all of the cash on Airbase’s balance sheet, which goes back to the company, shareholders and employees. Including that, the entire value of the deal is actually “a little less than $400 million,” the source said. Airbase has just over 300 employees. It is not yet known how many will be joining Paylocity. The company over the years has competed with the likes of Ramp and Brex, with a focus on selling software from its early days. At one point, it said it surpassed “eight figures” in annual recurring revenue (ARR), although the company has not shared exact numbers. This isn’t the first exit for Kote, who in 2017sold Automatic to SiriusXM for over $100 million. Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintechhere.

Events,Ryan Breslow’s $450M Bolt deal said to involve a restraining order now,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/ryan-breslows-lofty-450m-bolt-deal-is-in-trouble/,"1:35 PM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment Ryan Breslow’s plan to get himself reinstalled as CEO of fintech company Bolt — and push througha $450 million fundraising dealthat would value the startup at a staggering $14 billion — has apparently stalled. According toForbes, Breslow sent an email to shareholders thanking them for signing off on the deal. The problem is that many of those investors, including Montauk Ventures and Ash Pournouri, claim they didn’t sign off on anything. Montauk’s founder, Philip Krim, told Forbes he does not support the financing, and Breslow didn’t have his permission to be included in a list of investors that had approved the deal. Meanwhile, BlackRock, along with Hedosophia and Untitled Ventures, reportedly applied for a restraining order in an attempt to “halt” Bolt’s Series F round. The trio claimed through an attorney that Bolt was “coercing its investors by forcing them to choose between paying millions of dollars for new stock or losing most of their existing investment.” Bolt declined TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Startup Battlefield,AWS unveils Mithra to identify and mitigate malicious domains across its massive system,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/aws-launches-mithra-to-identify-and-mitigate-malicious-domains/,"6:00 AM PDT • August 5, 2024","Comment When a company is the size of Amazon, a lot of bad actors will come after it and its customers, which makes defending the network a monster job. Over the years Amazon has developed a number of strategies, from machine learning and monitoring tools to good old-fashioned phone calling to identify and reduce risks to their network. The company on Monday revealed an internal umbrella platform for the first time that has been in place for several years, called Mithra, which it built to handle Amazon scale. The main piece of technology underlying the solution is a massive graph database with 3.5 billion nodes and 48 billion edges, according to C.J. Moses, Amazon’s chief information security officer (CISO). (Mithra runs on internal systems inside Amazon as opposed to being a service that customers pay for directly.) Moses says in simple terms that Mithra is basically a big funnel. “We have to go from lots of data down to very small amounts of data. The further you get down that funnel, the more you’re able to then have humans become engaged to be able to make the final decisions on what needs to be done,” Moses told TechCrunch. In some cases, where the software has a strong signal that a domain is bad, humans don’t even need to be involved in the decision making; at Amazon’s scale, taking humans out of the loop when it can is important. “If you get down to where you have strong assurance that a domain is bad, we’re able to take that data and very quickly transition it straight into the systems that protect our environments,” Moses said. That could involve the web application firewall (WAF), Amazon GuardDuty, the company’s threat detection system or even forwarding the domain in question to the AWS security service team for further review when required. Moses says when you combine Mithra withSonaris, the company’s network observation platform, it provides a “pretty good defensive net around our AWS and Amazon environments.” Amazon scale is unique.The company deals with a quarter of all internet traffic every day, according to Moses, and it “observes up to 200 trillion DNS requests in a single AWS Region alone. Mithra detects an average of 182,000 new malicious domains daily.” The company has been using a combination of AI, ML, algorithms, monitoring and other tooling, but as it grows and scales, it realized it needed to have a single platform dedicated to monitoring the system for malicious domains and snuffing them out whenever possible. That’s where Mithra comes in. AI plays a big role in a system this large, of course, and the company wouldn’t be able to deal with such a large graph database without AI. “The reality is that AI, in this particular case, or in many cases like this, is exactly the type of technology that you want to use in order to look at large scale amounts of data and identify throughout that data, the things that should be interesting to us,” Moses said. “And we can obviously train the AI to look for the aberrations, to look for the things that are outside of the norm, or those things that we’ve previously seen as malicious.” The AI models can also help humans make better decisions. “Are we going to block this domain or not? Here’s a preponderance of the data that’s been assembled from Mithra, from Sonaris, from other threat sensors that we have, and then use that AI to coalesce it together into recommendations to the different systems that take the defensive measures,” Moses said. Generative AI has a role to play because it enables the threat analysts, who are doing the threat hunting, to interact with the data in plain language and get back answers to help understand the situation better. Previously they would have had to run scripts, but generative AI provides a faster way to see what’s happening. Sometimes, it’s not about shutting down domains, or how sophisticated the tech is, but just being able to pick up the phone and call a fellow CISO about what his team is seeing. “Some of our biggest investment is in making sure we have a very viable CISO network so we can pick up the phone and call someone at 2 a.m. and not have it be a cold call, even if they’re not customers of ours,” he said. Update: This story has been updated to clarify when Mithra was launched. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startup Battlefield,CIOs’ concerns over generative AI echo those of the early days of cloud computing,https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/07/cios-concerns-over-generative-ai-echo-those-of-the-early-days-of-cloud-computing/,"9:00 AM PDT • July 7, 2024","Comment When I attended the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium in May, it struck me that as I listened to CIOs talking about the latest technology — in this case generative AI — I was reminded of another time at the same symposium in around 2010 when the talk was all about the cloud. It was notable how similar the concerns over AI were to the ones that I heard about the fledgling cloud all those years ago: Companies were concerned about governance (check), security (check) and responsible use of a new technology (check). But 2010 was just at the edge of the consumerization of IT where workers were looking for the same type of experience they had at home at work. Soon, they would resort to “shadow IT” to find those solutions on their own when IT said no, and no was the default in those days. It was easy enough for employees to go off on their own unless things went into total lockdown. Today, CIOs recognize if they just say no to generative AI, employees are probably going to find a way to use these tools anyway. There are plenty of legitimate concerns when it comes to this technology — likehallucinationsorwho owns the IP— but there are also concerns about security, compliance and controls, especially around data, thatlarge organizations demand and require. But CIOs speaking at the conference were much more realistic than they had been 15 years ago, even if they had similar concerns. “You know, everything’s out there and democratized,” said Mathematica CIO Akira Bell, speaking on a panel called “Sustaining Competitive Advantage in the Age of AI.” “I think somebody else this morning already said, ‘You know, we can’t control this moment.’ We cannot and don’t want to be ‘the agents of no,’ to tell everybody what they can and cannot do, but what we can do is make sure people understand the responsibility they have as actors and users of these tools.” Bell said that today, instead of saying no, she’s pushing responsible use of the technology and looking for ways to enhance their customers’ experience with AI. “So one is about governing, making sure our data is ready to be used, making sure our employees understand what best practices exist as they go on and use them.” She said that the second piece is really thinking about how they use generative AI to enhance their core capabilities, and how they might use it on behalf of clients to create or amplify or change existing service offerings to their customers. Bell said you must also look at the security component, so all of these things matter. Her organization can offer guidance on how to use these tools in a way that is consistent with the values of the company without shutting down access. Angelica Tritzo, CIO at GE Vernova, a new spinout from GE focused on alternative energy, is taking a deliberate approach to implementing generative AI. “We have a number of pilots in different maturity stages. We probably, like many others, do not fully understand the full potential, so the cost and the benefit is not always fully aligned,” Tritzo told TechCrunch. “We are finding our way with all the pieces of technology, how much to partner with others versus what we need to do ourselves.” But the process is helping her learn what works and what doesn’t and how to proceed while helping employees get familiar with it. Chris Bedi, who was CDIO (chief digital information officer) at ServiceNow, said that things will change in the coming years as employees start demanding access to AI tools. “From a talent standpoint, as organizations look to retain talent, which is a hot topic, it doesn’t matter what job function, people want their job talent to stay. I think it’ll be unthinkable to ask your company employees to do their jobs without GenAI,” Bedi told TechCrunch. What’s more, he believes the talent will start demanding it and question why you would want them to do work manually. (Bedi’s title recently changed to chief customer officer.) To that end, Bedi says his company is committed to teaching its employees about AI and how to create an AI-literate workforce because people won’t necessarily understand without guidance how to make best use of this technology. “We created some learning pathways, so everybody in the company had to take their AI 101,” he said. “We created that and selectively [levels] 201 and 301 because we know the future is AI, and so we have to get our whole workforce comfortable with it,” he said. All of this suggests that while the concerns may be the same as they were in the last wave of technological change, IT executives have perhaps learned some lessons along the way. They understand now that you can’t just lock it down. Instead they have to find ways to help employees use generative AI tools safely and effectively because if they don’t, employees will probably start using them anyway. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startup Battlefield,Dive goes cloud-native for its computational fluid dynamics simulation service,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/dive-goes-cloud-native-for-its-computational-fluid-dynamics-simulation-service/,"6:00 AM PDT • June 5, 2024","Comment Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are complex, computationally expensive and not typically something that startups focus on. But that’s exactly what Boston- and Berlin-basedDiveis doing. The company aims to change how manufacturers use computer simulations by using both modern mathematical approaches and cloud computing to disrupt a market that is mostly dominated by a small number of incumbents. Dive’s customer list includes the likes of BMW, BSH, Kärcher, Siemens and ZF. The company, which on Wednesday announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A round led by D.E. Shaw Group, was spun out of German multinational Bosch in 2018. Dive co-founder and CEOPierre Sabrowskitells me that he started working at Bosch during his PhD studies. His first few years were spent trying to simulate washing machines. “The washing machine seems like such a small thing, but there are, I think, 700 or 800 engineers these days — maybe even more — in Berlin, dedicatedly working on the washing machines of Bosch. So this is huge. It’s a huge market, and we were part of simulating that. And we simply failed,” he told me. The techniques available at the time simply weren’t good enough to simulate something as complex as fluids moving in a washing machine. But after a few years of trying, the team happened upona technique used by astrophysiciststhat treats fluids as being made up of particles instead of as an interconnected mesh, like older techniques did. The team at Bosch started extending an open source tool to perform those mesh-free simulations for its own needs, all while working on the fundamental science behind it, too. “The team around that group is pretty big and in 2017, our department lead said: ‘Hey, OK, the team is too big. We can’t afford that anymore in Bosch alone. The number of applications is also limited to what we can do at Bosch, so maybe you guys should start as a spin-off.’” At first, the team was mostly doing projects for clients because, as Sabrowski told me, the software itself wasn’t at a point where anybody outside of Dive could really use it yet. By 2021, though, Dive started selling licenses and then raised its seed round, even before it had a real 3D user interface to visualize the results. Some of Dive’s earliest customers came from the automotive industry, which is maybe no surprise, given its experiences with simulating liquids in closed, rotating environments. In that respect, washing machines and gear boxes aren’t all that different. The company also still targets household appliance manufacturers, as well as companies building dispensing systems. Offering a better simulation is definitely an incentive for Dive’s customers, but Sabrowski also stressed that the team spent a lot of time on how it wants to deliver its solution. In the end, Dive decided to go with a cloud-enabled solution, where the interface lives on the desktop. Dive’s Series A round was led by D.E. Shaw, with First Momentum Ventures, Segenia Capital and Senovo Capital participating in Dive’s seed round. The company plans to use the new funding to expand its simulation portfolio to cover a wider range of use cases and strengthen its data analytics and data governance programs. Dive’s customers are already storing their engineering data in Dive’s cloud platform, after all, so helping them best analyze and leverage that data is an obvious next step. “We’re excited about Dive’s potential to transform the manufacturing and computer-aided engineering industries,” said Jean Nations of the D. E. Shaw Group. “Dive’s mesh-free and cloud-native approach is designed to enable engineers to create simulations that reduce industrial production timelines and costs, leading to greater efficiency in the engineering process.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Startup Battlefield,Stacklet sees demand grow as companies take cloud cost control more seriously,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/04/stacklet-sees-demand-grow-as-companies-take-cloud-cost-control-more-seriously/,"6:00 AM PDT • June 4, 2024","Comment WhenStacklet’sfounders, Travis Stanfield and Kapil Thangavelu, came out of Capital One in 2020 to launch their startup, most companies weren’t all that concerned with constraining cloud costs. But in the ensuing years, as they experienced economic headwinds, first from the pandemic, and then rising interest rates, it became an imperative. As such, Stacklet’s cloud cost control and governance platform has seen a rise in popularity. In fact, CEO Stanfield says that while he can’t get into specific numbers, revenue tripled year over year in 2023. Investors apparently liked what they saw, and made a $14.5 million investment to capitalize on the continued growth. TechCrunch’s Frederic Lardinois described the company’s core commercial product ina 2021 article, showing that cost control is just one part of the offering: “Stacklet helps enterprises manage their data governance stance across different clouds, accounts, policies and regions, with a focus on security, cost optimization and regulatory compliance. The service offers its users a set of pre-defined policy packs that encode best practices for access to cloud resources, though users can obviously also specify their own rules. In addition, Stacklet offers a number of analytics functions around policy health and resource auditing, as well as a real-time inventory and change management logs for a company’s cloud assets.” The company also has a true open source piece calledCloud Custodian. The two founders helped develop the software when they were working at Capital One, before leaving to launch Stacklet. The project was open sourced in 2016, and became part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2019. Some open source projects have switched tomore restrictive licensesin recent years, but Thangavelu says that won’t happen with this one, because it is part of the CNCF forever. As for protecting the commercial product from being cannibalized by the free version, he says there is too much separation between the two for the open source to threaten the company’s core commercial offering. “The open source project is a stateless rules engine. It’s just a CLI (command line interface). With our commercial product, we bring a platform to help people accelerate out of the box with context, and give them value and additional capabilities that don’t exist within the open source piece,” he said. Stanfield says they have found that the cost control piece is particularly important to customers, something that wasn’t always the case. In the early days of the company, most folks didn’t have any notion of FinOps, the name given for controlling cloud spending inside organizations. Yet it has become even more important in recent years with the growing popularity of AI, which tends to be resource intensive. “Certainly as folks continue to evolve their own products and services and push deeper into cloud, they need to have the expenditures well controlled, and what we essentially focus on in the FinOps domain is the continuous usage optimization — everything that the developers might be using in cloud, and keeping that aligned to their efficiency best practices,” Stanfield said. He says that as they continue to grow they need to find the right balance between growth and efficiency, and they intend to err on the side of caution when it comes to spending, even with the new influx of money, while investing only when it makes sense to help them accelerate. It’s worth noting that this investment is less than the previous round in 2021 when the companyraised $18 million, but Stanfield says it’s a different time and they feel good about the number. “We feel fortunate. Certainly, given the economic climate that we have been in recent years, we got a lot of really fantastic investors around the table,” he told TechCrunch. Today’s round was led by SineWave VC with participation from Strait Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures, Capital One Ventures, Foundation Capital and Relentless Ventures. Stacklet has now raised $36.5 million, according to the company.

Startup Battlefield,Firefly forges on after co-founder murdered by Hamas,https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/29/after-co-founders-murder-at-the-hands-of-hamas-cloud-startup-firefly-raises-23m/,"9:56 AM PDT • May 29, 2024","Comment A startup calledFireflythat’s tackling the thorny and growing issue of cloud asset management with an “infrastructure as code” solution has raised $23 million in funding. That comes on the heels of strong demand for its tech and increasing revenue fourfold in 2023. The firm’s latest success also comes on the heels of tragedy, as co-founder CTO Joseph “Sefi” Genis was among the hundreds killed by Hamas in October 2023 at the now-infamous Nova music festival. The firm finds itself at the intersection of technology and major world events for the second time. Firefly was hatched in 2021 in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, amid a huge burst of “digital transformation.” Suddenly faced with remote workforces, organizations turned to the cloud in a big way to manage those workers and to launch new services. Those migrating into the cloud seized on a big opportunity to work more flexibly and efficiently, but their move also carries risk. As companies spread their work across multiple containers, clouds, apps and devices, ops teams have trouble tracking their digital assets — living or dormant — and that can have major implications for cost, security, and operations. “How do you handle so much complexity?” asks Firefly CEO Ido Neeman (sitting in the center in the picture above). “You can’t. The proliferation of tools is too overwhelming.” Firefly’s services address this with tech that can scan assets in clouds from major providers, including Google, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, along with private clouds, containers, apps and more. Using AI technology, the company creates a snapshot of the situation and immediately begins to highlight what might appear to conflict with something else, along with suggestions for how to remediate the problems. Firefly’s remediations are delivered in the form of “infrastructure as code,” which is used by DevOps and related teams as a way to provision and manage cloud resources, using code rather than physical or interactive tooling. “We do this by automatically and instantly discovering your entire cloud footprint across all the clouds, all the technologies, all the infrastructure’s code,” Neeman explained. “We discover everything on your cloud footprint. Then we scan it to detect which part of your cloud is properly controlled and qualified. You control it, you own it, it’s well-governed versus unmanaged, misconfigured, or inefficient. Once we find such chaos, we’ll give you automatic remedies to fix it.” The company had recently launched an AI that suggested and could execute the code automatically, but it disabled that feature for some bigger customers, who were concerned about hallucinations and simply getting things wrong. We still have a ways to go before everyone signs up for all AI, all the time. Regardless, just as HubSpot might be used for marketing assets, or ServiceNow for infrastructure resources, Firefly wants to be “the source of truth, the cloud control pane” for the cloud, Neeman said. The company’s remediation by default comes in the form of suggestions, and it’s ultimately up to DevOps to decide whether these should be implemented. Vertex, a previous backer, led this Series A with participation from two other returning investors — Hanaco and SoftBank — as well as new strategic backer InMotion Ventures (the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover) and Redseed, a fund created by ex-DST partners and founders. Firefly had previously raised $6.5 million, and it’s not disclosing its valuation. Raising money as a successful startup these days can feel like a major win in itself. But it’s even more of an achievement when the funding comes after a crushing blow. The startup has headquarters in Foster City in the Bay Area, and most of its customers are in the U.S., but it was founded and retains significant operations in Israel, which put it on the front lines of tragedy when Genis was murdered. (He is on the right side in the photo above.) Genis’ death came after a protracted attempt to evade the attackers, an effort he shared through text messages with his wife. Ultimately, Genis and a friend went into hiding. Cornered, they could see that there was no escaping a particular armed Hamas attacker. Without an option to flee further, the pair tried to overtake him. They both died. But the effort had a heroic ending: The distraction they provided saved the lives of others who had been hiding with Genis and his friend. “Thanks to the fact that they attacked the terrorist, they prevented him from entering the shelter and seeing that there were other people there,” one of the survivorssaid in a TV interview. The attack at the Nova festival and surrounding villages kicked off a protracted and controversial war in Gaza, resulting in tens of thousands more casualties amid the destruction of an entire territory. Firefly represents the contradictions and complexities of the situation for the people and businesses in Israel and Gaza, many of whom are inherently involved in a conflict bigger than themselves, whether they want to be or not. Some will try to find a way to a brighter place despite that. Neeman, who co-founded Firefly with Genis and CPO Eran Bibi (pictured far left), said that the startup had been planning to raise money before this happened — a plan that was paused in the immediate aftermath. “We needed to handle this awful, awful situation,” Neeman explained. “He was not just the CTO, not just the co-founder, of Firefly. He was a very close friend to me, to Eran, to the entire team. Sefi was such a beautiful soul, just smiling and happy and honestly, a genius. So it was hard.” They delayed funding for months, but also thought of how to soldier on (short of becoming soldiers in the literal sense). “I think that the entire team became stronger out of it,” he said. “We are now all committed to making his vision come true. Sefi wanted to solve cloud complexity, so for us, his legacy lives on through making Firefly a big, successful company.” Growth began to accelerate, with the company growing fourfold over 2023 and doubling sales and customer counts in the last six months. “We signed some of the largest logos in the Fortune 500, and we created some amazing new capabilities to make cloud operations much more simple. We’ve added some great team members. We know we will always remember our good friend, but we’re optimistic. We’re seeing the future.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Fintech,Bending Spoons plans to lay off 75% of WeTransfer staff after acquisition,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/bending-spoons-plans-to-lay-off-75-of-wetransfer-staff-after-acquisition/,"9:24 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Italy-based app company Bending Spoons, which owns Evernote and Meetup, is planning to lay off 75% of the staff of file transfer service WeTransfer, TechCrunch has learned. Bending Spoonsacquired the Dutch company in July for an undisclosed amount. The company confirmed the plans for the WeTransfer layoff to TechCrunch. The staff that is being let go will be informed after Bending Spoons goes through local regulations in different countries regarding lay offs. Dutch media reported thatWeTransfer has over 350 employees. Bending Spoons CEO Luca Ferrari said that typically, the company studies the organization that it is acquiring and determines what is the best vision of the business going forward with an aim to operate it forever. “Once the vision is clear, we try to close the gap between the status quo and the vision as quickly and as fully as we can. Typically, doing so involves making major changes to many areas, including the organization. While we don’t enjoy making painful or unpopular decisions, we’re prepared to do so when we believe it’s the right thing to do to help the business thrive,” he said. Ferrari also noted that in WeTransfer’s case, Bending Spoons wanted to have a small and focused team. “In this particular case, the vision we developed is of a smaller, more sharply focused WeTransfer organization, which we believe will be better-positioned to serve WeTransfer’s success with a long-term view,” the CEO said. Since its acquisition, WeTransfer has rolled outa new feature to let users extend the expiry date of a link on the app. However, Bending Spoons or WeTransfer hasn’t disclosed their plans about long-term product roadmap. The layoffs are not surprising as Bending Spoons regularly cuts the employee count of companies it acquires in order to operate them profitably. In February 2023, it cut 129 employees fromEvernote’s staff. In December 2023, the company let go of the entire workforce of Filmic,the popular photo and video editing app that it acquired in 2022. Earlier this year, Meetup alsofaced job cuts after its acquisition. In February, Bending Spoons raised$155 million in equity financingfrom new investor Durable Capital Partners and existing ones, including Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, NB Renaissance, NUO Capital, and StarTIP (controlled by Tamburi Investment Partners).

Fintech,X is hiring staff for security and safety after two years of layoffs,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/x-is-hiring-staff-for-security-and-safety-after-two-years-of-layoffs/,"12:35 PM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment Nearlytwo yearsafter the layoffs across X’s trust, safety and security teams, Elon Musk’s social media company is now trying to hire new employees to help moderate content and secure its platform, according to X’sofficial job listings. In the last month, X posted two dozen job openings evenly split across itssafetyandcybersecurity teams. The jobs on X’s safety team range from director of strategic response on X’s safety team to government affairs managers. On its cybersecurity teams, X is hiring several security engineers and a threat intelligence specialist. These are small numbers compared to the number of staff Musk laid off following his$44 billion acquisitionof the company, formerly known as Twitter, in late 2022. In April 2023,Musk told the BBCthat Twitter, as it was known then, reduced its headcount by 6,000 workers in six months, leaving the company’s workforce at around 1,500 employees when layoffs were completed. Those cuts had included significant reductions for the company’s trust and safety team. In January this year, following an inquiry from Australia’s online safety commissioner, X said that it had laid off 80% of its trust and safety staff since Musk’s takeover. X also said in its responses that before Musk’s acquisition, the company had 279 engineers on its trust and safety teams around the world, which were cut down to 55 by the end of May 2023. Overall, X said it reduced its 4,062-strong trust and safety team by almost a third to 2,849 employees; its full-time content moderation team from 107 to 51 employees; and its contracted moderators from 2,613 to 2,305 employees,according to the Australian eSafety Commissioner’s report at the time. The recent job listings appear to confirm that X is trying to further beef up its safety teamfollowing the company’s announcement in Januarythat it would create a new Trust and Safety center in Austin, Texas, which will include 100 full-time content moderators. Nine of the two-dozen jobs posted in the last month mention Austin among the possible locations, though the postings also include other cities, like New York City and Palo Alto, California, plus international offices like Manila in the Philippines and Delhi in India. When TechCrunch asked X’s press team a series of questions about these new hires, including the size of the company’s safety and cybersecurity teams, the company responded with an automated message: “Busy now, please check back later.” Departure’s in X’s trust and safety and cybersecurity teams have not been limited to its staff, but also included senior leadership. Since Musk took over, both the company’s chief cybersecurity officerLea Kissnerand the company’s trust and safety leadElla Irwinhave left. The reduction in staff on the trust and safety and cybersecurity teams appear to have hurt X’s ability to secure itself and its users, as well as deal with complex content moderation issues all over the world. On Friday, the Supreme Court in Brazilessentially banned Xacross the country after Musk refused to remove accounts spreading misinformation. Since taking over as Twitter’s owner, Musk himself has been accused of spreading hateful content and misinformation. On Tuesday,Musk promoted a podcast episodefeaturing a guestaccused of engaging in Holocaust denialism. Also this week, Muskposted on Xseveral images from an AI generator showing someone that looks vaguely like Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a beret with the Communist hammer-and-sickle. On the cybersecurity side, Musk hosted an X Spaces event with former President Donald Trump, whichcrashed and was delayed. Musk blamed the crash — without providing evidence — on “a massive [distributed denial-of-service] attack on X.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Fintech,Apple reportedly cuts 100 jobs working on Books and other services,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/apple-reportedly-cuts-around-100-jobs-working-on-books-and-other-services/,"8:37 AM PDT • August 28, 2024","Comment Apple is conducting layoffs affecting around 100 employees working for the company’s digital services group, according toBloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The main group affected by the cuts is the team working for the Apple Books app and its related store. Introduced in 2010 by then-CEO Steve Jobsin conjunction with the iPad’s debut, Apple Books hasn’t been the “Kindle-killer” that Apple expected. These job cuts indicate Apple Books isn’t going to be an investment area for Apple going forward. The team working for Apple News is also affected by the layoffs, as well as other services teams. During Apple’s last quarterly earnings, servicesrepresented 28% of its revenue. However, a significant portion of that revenue likely comes from in-app purchases and App Store subscriptions. It’s unclear whether Apple will be able to maintain its grip on mobile app distribution in a changing regulatory landscape. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Fintech,Brave lays off 27 employees,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/brave-lays-off-27-employees/,"2:12 AM PDT • August 28, 2024","Comment Web browser and search startup Brave has laid off 27 employees across the different departments, TechCrunch has learned. The company confirmed the layoffs but didn’t give more details about the total headcount left nor the reason for the layoffs. PitchBook, however,estimatesthat Brave has around 191 employees, working out to Brave cutting 14% of staff. The new round of job cuts comes about 10 months after the company let go of9% of its total workforce in October 2023. At that time, Brave said the cuts were due to “cost management in this challenging economic environment.” After initially fashioning itself as a “blockchain browser” and adding severalcrypto-related features, Brave has more recently leaned into AI with its product releases this year.The company launched its AI assistant, Leo, ondesktop,Android,iPad, and iPhonein a staggered release cycle. The companyintegrated its own search results with its Leo chatbotin June. Users could, for example, use the chatbot to ask about the score of a sports match or get additional context about an article they are reading without navigating to a search page. The company is also selling a Leo Premium subscription for $14.99 per month for access to better models and higher limit rates. Earlier this month, Brave started letting all userslink their own modelsto use in the browser after testing the ability for a few months. Brave has not detailed the cost of developing and running these AI-focused features, and it is not clear  if that cost connected to this wave of layoffs. Powered byWordPress VIP"

Cloud Computing,Electro-hydraulic muscles help these robot legs stand straight on uneven terrain,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/electro-hydraulic-muscles-help-these-robot-legs-stand-straight-on-uneven-terrain/,"2:00 AM PDT • September 9, 2024","Comment Researchers at ETH Zürich are very good at keeping robots standing upright. Back in 2022, the school’s robotics team taught the quadrupedal ANYmal robothow to hikeup mountains without falling over.New research from the school, published in collaboration with the Stuttgart-based Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, takes a unique approach to the problem of traversing uneven terrain. Artificial muscles showcased by the schools are powered by a hybrid electro-hydraulic system. Along with the ability to adjust automatically to the surface they’re traversing, the legs move faster and jump higher than their more standardized electric counterparts, all without requiring additional sensors or controls. The legs’ actuators are surprisingly simple. The teams describe them as “oil-filled plastic bags, similar to those used to make ice cubes.” Those bags are then covered in electrodes. Honestly, the whole thing sounds a bit like a school science project. “[A]s soon as we apply a voltage to the electrodes, they are attracted to each other due to static electricity,” says grad student Thomas Buchner. “Similarly, when I rub a balloon against my head, my hair sticks to the balloon due to the same static electricity.” The bags then expand or contract, based on the voltage being applied. Unlike standard electric actuators, the system doesn’t generate a lot of heat. So the actuators help the system traverse uneven terrain and help it jump high. In terms of real-world use, however, the system still has a long way to go. “Compared to walking robots with electric motors, our system is still limited. The leg is currently attached to a rod, jumps in circles and can’t yet move freely,” says Christoph Keplinger, a professor at Max Planck Institute. “If we combine the robotic leg in a quadruped robot or a humanoid robot with two legs, maybe one day, when it is battery-powered, we can deploy it as a rescue robot.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Cloud Computing,Apple Intelligence delays could impede iPhone 16 ‘supercycle’,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/apple-intelligence-delays-could-impede-iphone-16-supercycle/,"12:25 PM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment When Apple unveiled itsAI plans at WWDC in June, analystssuggestedthe feature could put the iPhone 16 on track for another “supercycle.” Like the addition of5Gbefore it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence’s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device. We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s“It’s Glowtime”event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it’s believed that Apple Intelligence’s slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential. In June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience.Trained on small models— instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — Apple’s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI. AsBloomberg notestoday, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16’s bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we’reunlikely to seemany delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China — the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch. In the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there’s still a lot of catching up to do. At the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow’s event is set to change that, especially asfurther rumorspoint to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros. While sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company’s bottom line than a staggered rollout.

Among the more interesting of recent vintage (all Apple Watch related): The Apple Watch Series 10’s blood pressure monitoring isnotcomingto the Watch Ultra 2, limited Apple Intelligence features for the Watch, though it will be baked into afuture fitness coach-style feature. Both models are reportedly getting that sleep apnea feature, though itlikely won’t be available at launch. Sometimes a headline is enough. Apple will reveal the iPhone 16 at itsSeptember 9“It’s Glowtime”event; this much we can tell you for certain. But Apple doesn’t invite us to fly across the country for a single product — not to mention booking a hotel room on the 49ers opening day. Football aside, the timing of the annual event is important, as it’s one last major opportunity to announce a bunch of hardware ahead of the holidays. The livestream kicks off onMonday at 10 a.m. PT. The invites dropped last week with the “Glowtime” tag line and a color scheme to match. Apple loves to sprinkle small hints into these graphics, and this one appears more on the nose than most. Back at WWDC in June, Apple finally revealed its approach to generative AI. The offering is an extremely Apple approach, right down to the name —Apple Intelligence— which happily hijacks the familiar AI initialism. The “small model” method is emblematic of the company in the sense that it’s trained on limited data relevant to improving the user experience. That’s a marked difference between it and much larger “black box” models like OpenAI’s andGoogle’s Gemini. The efficacy of the approach remains to be seen, as we wait for Apple Intelligence’s wider release. It will almost certainly be a work in progress, as — at the very least — all of generative AI is, at the end of the day. The answer for how this all ties into “Glowtime” can be found in Siri. In June, Apple announced amuch-needed glow up for the O.G. smart assistant. Along with generative AI models and better app integration, the company revealed an updated interface. Gone is the familiar colorful Siri circle, swapped out for a glowing border that surrounds the display when Siri is listening/processing. Out of every iPhone ever launched,two models will be able to run Apple Intelligence: the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. According to the company, that’s due to limitations with older chips. Given that non-Pro iPhone 15 models are effectively running the iPhone 14 Pro’s chipset, Apple can credibly make the argument that only one of its chips so far was built with Apple Intelligence in mind. You can decide for yourself whether you think the exclusion of the iPhone 15 is entirely a hardware matter. With all of this in mind, next week’s event is the perfect chance to announce that Apple Intelligence will be available across the new iPhone line. We’re heading toward the promise of true edge-to-edge displays millimeter by millimeter. According to one recent leak, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an even larger display, courtesy of smaller bezels, moving from 1.5mm to 1.4mm. So, what’s a few fractions of a millimeter between friends? A lot when you’re talking about a total size of under 2mm, turns out. That will reportedly bump the Pro Max’s screen size from 6.69 to 6.86 inches, without increasing the device’s overall footprint by some unwieldy amount. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is already a big phone. The iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, is said to be making the leap from 6.12 to 6.27 inches. Camera improvements are a no-brainer for annual updates. The most interesting of the bunchis a new glass molded lensthat is thinner and lighter, while dramatically increasing optical zoom capabilities. Optical zoom capabilities are worth paying attention to, as they don’t suffer from the same sort of image degradation issues as their digital counterpart. Leakeddummy modelsfrom early in the year give us a rough idea of each model’s design. Most notable on the 16 and 16 Plus are the shift from a diagonal to vertical camera setup. The models, which are designed for third parties to get a jumpstart on accessories, feature the addition of a new “Capture” button across the line. The new feature is designed to provide quick access to different camera capabilities. The most welcome change, however, may bebigger batteries. Screen and camera improvements are all well and good, but battery life remains a struggle. This particular report could use more substantiating, so take that with an even larger grain of salt than usual. Additionalreports, meanwhile, have pointed to Apple making battery replacements more accessible for users. Given that the company has begun offering home repair options as more governments and localities pass right to repair laws, this one certainly tracks. The Pro models are alsoexpected to gainWi-Fi 7, which would be a big boon for the latest wireless standard. As hard as it is to believe, the Apple Watch turns 10 this year. They grow up so quickly. Apple made a big splash with the iPhone X, so it follows that it’d have something similar planned for the Apple Watch Series 10 (Series X?). Earlier rumors pointing to a significant redesign have cooled in recent months, making way for a familiar design with a larger display, bumping up to 45mm and 49mm models. The new watch should also be slimmer than its predecessor — something especially important when discussing a watch. Like the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 should get a new processor — the S10, one imagines. That could mean that additional AI functionality isn’t far out. A glucose monitor is the most exciting rumored addition. Sleep apnea detection is also rumored for the device, but asBloomberg notes, Apple’slegal woes with Masimomay well trip up that feature. A long-awaited update to the budget Apple Watch SE with a plastic body could also appear next week. Stay with me onthis one. Apple is reportedly announcing two versions of the AirPods 4 next week. The cheaper model will replace the still-available AirPods 2, and the more premium version will replace the AirPods 3. Still with me? The more premium model is set to blur the line between it and the AirPods Pro, by adding Active Noise Cancelation and Find My features. All of the models should also finally ditch Lightning for USB-C, as the company transitions its productsto comply with EU mandates. So, how will Apple maintain a clear line between the mid-tier and Pro pods? We’ll have to wait on the answer to that one, as we’re not expecting new AirPods Pro next week. We may, however,finallyget the over-earAirPods Max 2,four years after the original. This one is a big maybe.Recent reportingsuggests that Apple will hold off on announcing M4 macs until November. Supply chain issues have been dictating the Mac’s release calendar ever since the pandemic. A big,USB-A-less version of the Mac Miniis said to be arriving before end of year, along with a new iMac and MacBook Pro. Here’s what we can say for sure: Apple’s Glowtime event is scheduled for Monday, September 9 at 10 a.m. PT. As always, we’ll be there, bringing it to you live. Powered byWordPress VIP"

Layoffs,Google faces provisional antitrust charges in UK for ‘self-preferencing’ its ad exchange,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/google-faces-provisional-antitrust-charges-in-uk-for-self-preferencing-its-ad-exchange/,"3:41 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment More antitrust woes for Google. The U.K’.s competition watchdog said on Friday that it suspects the company of adtech antitrust abuses. The tech giant will now have a chance to respond to the provisional findings before the regulator reaches a final decision. Confirmed violations of U.K. competition law can lead to corrective orders and fines of up to 10% of annual worldwide group turnover. So the outcome of this case is likely to be closely watched. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating Google’s role in the adtech stack over suspected abuses of dominance sinceMay 2022. The new development is the sending of a formal statement of objections to Google setting out provisional findings that accuse the adtech giant of self-preferencing its own ad exchange at the expense of customers and rivals. The CMA said it believes Google’s practices could be harming “thousands” of U.K. publishers and advertisers who rely on its adtech to bid for and sell advertising space. The adtech space is little understood by consumers but it’s inextricably entwined with the mainstream web. As web users browse the internet, they are profiled using tracking technologies like cookies. Data about them is traded between different types of adtech platforms to power high velocity, real-time trading of ad space in a bid to match ads with eyeballs. Google has a kingpin role in this lucrative programmatic ads business. But the CMA suspects it’s skewed the deck in its favor. “The CMA is concerned that Google is actively using its dominance in this sector to preference its own services,” it wrote in apress release. “Google disadvantages competitors and prevents them competing on a level playing field to provide publishers and advertisers with a better, more competitive service that supports growth in their business.” Google dominates the adtech stack — playing a powerful intermediary role in “three key parts” of the chain, per the CMA, including offering ad buying tools for advertisers (Google Ads and DV360); a publisher ad server (DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP); and an ad exchange (AdX). The CMA noted AdX is where Google charges its highest fees in the adtech stack (“approximately 20% of the bid amount”). It’s concerned Google has been able to give AdX an unfair advantage by applying self-preferencing tactics across different links of the chain. “The CMA has provisionally found that, since at least 2015, Google has abused its dominant positions through the operation of both its buying tools and publisher ad server in order to strengthen AdX’s market position and to protect AdX from competition from other exchanges,” it wrote. “Moreover, due to the highly integrated nature of Google’s ad tech business, the CMA has provisionally found that Google’s conduct has also prevented rival publisher ad servers from being able to compete effectively with DFP, harming competition in this market.” In terms of the specific Google practices it’s objecting to, the CMA said these are various and have evolved over time — but examples it cites include: The regulator has also provisionally found Google’s abusive conduct ongoing. “The CMA is therefore considering what may be required to ensure that Google ceases the anti-competitive practices, and that Google does not engage in similar practices in the future,” it added. We understand structural remedies — such as requiring Google to sell off certain adtech units — could be part of these considerations. The European Union, which has its own antitrust probe of Google’s adtech (ongoing since 2021), warnedlast yearthat if it concludes the company has broken the bloc’s competition laws, the only viable solution would be to break up its adtech business. Commenting in a statement, Juliette Enser, interim executive director of enforcement at the CMA, said: “We’ve provisionally found that Google is using its market power to hinder competition when it comes to the ads people see on websites.” “Many businesses are able to keep their digital content free or cheaper by using online advertising to generate revenue. Adverts on these websites and apps reach millions of people across the UK — assisting the buying and selling of goods and services. That’s why it’s so important that publishers and advertisers — who enable this free content — can benefit from effective competition and get a fair deal when buying or selling digital advertising space.” Reached for comment, a Google representative sent a statement attributed to Dan Taylor, its VP of Global Ads, who rejected the CMA’s findings. “Our advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers,” Taylor wrote. “Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The core of this case rests on flawed interpretations of the ad tech sector. We disagree with the CMAs view and we will respond accordingly.” The company’s adtech empire is also under investigation on home soil. The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against it inJanuary last year— accusing Google of operating an unlawful, anticompetitive and exclusionary adtech monopoly.

Layoffs,Google’s AI-powered Ask Photos feature begins US rollout,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/googles-ai-powered-ask-photos-feature-begins-u-s-rollout/,"9:50 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment Firstannouncedat Google’s I/O developer conference this May, Google Photos’ AI-powered search feature, “Ask Photos,”is rolling out to usersstarting Thursday. The feature, which allows users to ask the AI to find photos using more complex queries, will initially be available in “early access” to select customers in the U.S. before expanding to a wider user base. Powered by Google’s Gemini AI model, Ask Photos lets users search their photos using natural language queries that leverage the AI’s understanding of their photo’s content and other metadata. Previously, Google Photos users could search for particular people, places or things in their photos, but the AI upgrade will allow them to ask a larger variety of questions, including those that require a deeper understanding of the photos. For example, as Google suggested during I/O, you could ask for the “best photo from each of the National Parks I visited.” The AI uses a variety of signals to determine what’s the “best” of a given set, including things like lighting, blurriness and lack of background distortion, among other things. It would then combine that with its understanding of the geolocation of the photos to find those taken at National Parks. Google said the feature could be used for more than just photo retrieval alone; users would also be able to ask questions to get helpful answers. For instance, a parent could ask Google Photos which themes they had used for their child’s last four birthdays. The AI would be able to analyze party photos and determine if a theme was involved, like “mermaid,” “princess,” “superhero” or anything else. It could then tell the parent when those themes were last used. More practical questions could be those that help you recall a specific event, like “what did we order last time at this restaurant” — presuming you like to photograph your meals. Or you could ask “where did we camp last time” at a specific destination, like Yosemite, the company suggests. You could also use the feature to help you put together photos for an album or to summarize all the things you did on a trip. The AI understands the context of your photo gallery, including the important people in your life, your hobbies, your favorite foods and other relevant details and memories. To access Ask Photos, select U.S. users will be able to find the feature within Google Labs, as it’s still in the experimental phase. The company says the feature’s development is guided by itsAI Principles, and the private data in Photos will never be used for ad targeting. However, Google employees may review users’ queries to help improve the AI over time. The AI’s answers will not be reviewed by humans, unless the user reaches out for support, to provide feedback, or to report abuse or harm. Interested users can sign up on thewaitlistfor early access to Ask Photos. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Layoffs,Google expands AI-powered virtual try-on tool to include dresses,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/google-expands-ai-powered-virtual-try-on-tool-include-dresses/,"8:10 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment GoogleannouncedThursday that it expanded its generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool to support dresses, allowing users to virtually wear thousands of dresses from hundreds of brands, including Boden, Maje, Sandro, Simkhai and Staud. According to the company, dresses were one of the most searched apparel categories for the tool. However, as Google explained in today’s blog post, its current diffusion technique is challenging to use with dresses, as they are more detailed and complex compared to other clothing items. To provide more context, Google Shoppingreleasedthe tool last year, using its own diffusion technology to create high-quality, lifelike images of tops and blouses. It simulates how the clothing would drape, fold, cling and form wrinkles and shadows on real people in various poses. Due to the intricate details of dresses, the existing diffusion model struggled to accurately capture detailed dress prints such as floral or geometric patterns. While the model could handle low-resolution images, a different method was needed for dresses to avoid losing important details. To address this issue, Google said it developed a new training strategy that starts with lower-resolution images and gradually incorporates higher resolutions. Additionally, as dresses typically cover most of the body and come in various lengths (such as midi, maxi and mini), placing a virtual dress on a person often leads to the obscuring or blurring of body details. A new technique called the VTO-UNet Diffusion Transformer (VTO-UDiT) aims to solve this problem by preserving a person’s features while erasing and replacing the dress, resulting in a more accurate portrayal of both the dress and the person wearing it. Virtual try-on technologyaims to eliminate the guesswork when it comes to finding the right fit for customers of all body types. Various companies (Adobe,AmazonandWalmart) have launched their own tools, allowing customers to virtually try on all types of clothing, including dresses. However, with this new expansion, it seems that Google is looking to create a more advanced feature than its competitors. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Hardware,"UK regulator greenlights Microsoft’s Inflection acquihire, but also designates it a merger",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/uk-regulator-greenlights-microsofts-inflection-acquihire-but-also-designates-it-a-merger/,"4:55 AM PDT • September 4, 2024","Comment Good news for Microsoft: The U.K.’s antitrust regulatorsaysthat the tech titan’s high-profileacquihire of the team behind AI startup Inflectiondoesn’t cause competition concerns, and thus it won’t be pursuing a full-scale investigation. However, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says that the deal — reportedly valued at around $650 million — does fall under its regulatory purview as a “relevant merger situation,” meaning similar deals in the future may still be investigated on competition grounds — even if a full acquisition has not taken place. Microsoftlaunched a new consumer AI divisionback in March, which Inflection co-foundersMustafa Suleymanand Karén Simonyan (respectively, also previously a co-founder and ascientistat Google DeepMind) are spearheading. CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that a number of other Inflection AI membershad joinedMicrosoft’s new AI unit, such as AI scientist Jordan Hoffmann, who isnow heading up Microsoft’s U.K. AI hub in London. Back in July, the CMArevealedthat it was launching a “phase 1” merger inquiry into the deal, kickstarting an investigation to gather evidence and decide whether to proceed with a full probe. Central to the initial phase was whether the deal could in fact be investigated as a “merger,” given that Microsoft hadn’t actually acquired Inflection AI. And if it did qualify as a merger, whether further action is required to counter competition concerns. At the heart of all this is a growing push by Big Tech companies to circumvent regulatory scrutiny around AI,powered by a new M&A approachthat some have dubbed the “quasi-merger“; this could involve anything from strategic investments, to — as we’ve seen with Microsoft and Inflection — hiring startup founders and technical talent. In its findings, the CMA notes that Microsoft hired “almost all of Inflection’s team,” including two of its founders, while simultaneously entering into a series of commercial agreements such as a nonexclusive licensing deal to use Inflection’s intellectual property (IP). (The exact number was never specified, but reportedly it was around 70 others.) Moreover, the CMA concluded that prior to their hiring, the Inflection team’s self-proclaimed remit was “creating AI for everyone,” but with the lion’s share of the team leaving Inflection, Microsoft had “acquired the team’s collective know-how” to develop its own AI smarts. The CMA writes in its assessment: Given that any technology in this space can quickly become obsolete without ongoing development, the CMA notes the importance of expertise to the development and supply of FMs [foundation models] and chatbots. Based on the evidence seen by the CMA, the team of staff responsible for development is therefore at the core of any business seeking to develop FMs or chatbots. In this context, the CMA considers that acquiring a team with relevant know-how — even without further assets — may fall within the CMA’s merger control jurisdiction. One of the core criteria used in this judgment stems from the U.K.’s Enterprise Act 2002, which helps define what a “relevant merger situation” actually means. This includes whether, as a result of a transaction, “two or more enterprises cease to be distinct.” Although Inflectionstill exists as a stand-alone business, the heart and brains of the company now lie at Microsoft. And this “value” that Microsoft procured cost it a fairly chunky $650 million,according to a reportin The Information from March, a fee it’s paying Inflection substantively to license Inflection’s foundation models and make them available on Microsoft’s Azure cloud. So it’s easy to see why some might view this arrangement as an acquisition in all but name. “The transfer of employees, coupled with other tactical arrangements, mean that two enterprises are no longer distinct,” Joel Bamford, the CMA’s executive director, wrote in aLinkedIn post today. Despite all this, the second facet of the CMA investigation concluded that the transaction didn’t pose any significant competition concerns, owing to the fact that Inflection was not a significant enough competitor to Microsoft’s existing AI tools. “Inflection AI is not a strong competitor to the consumer chatbots that Microsoft has developed directly (Copilot) and in partnership with OpenAI (ChatGPT),” Bamford wrote. “On this basis, we cleared the transaction.” The original Microsoft-Inflection probe constitutedone of several similar inquiriesannounced by the CMA back in April. This included Microsoft’sinvestment in French startup Mistral AI, with the regulator swiftly concluding that the dealdidn’t qualify for investigationunder current merger regulations due to the size of the investment. At the same time, the CMA revealed it was looking at Amazon’s ties with Anthropic in the wake of its$4 billion investmentinto the AI startup — this isnow the subject of a formal probe. Elsewhere, the CMA is also inviting interested parties and stakeholdersto commenton Google’s ties with Anthropic, after the internet giant invested areported $300 millionlast yearfollowed by a further $2 billion. So the main takeaway from all this is that Microsoft may have escaped regulatory intervention on this occasion, but future deals involving Big Tech and smaller startups are very much on the CMA’s radar — regardless of whether a full acquisition has taken place.

Hardware,North Korean hackers exploited Chrome zero-day to steal crypto,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/30/north-korean-hackers-exploited-chrome-zero-day-to-steal-crypto/,"10:13 AM PDT • August 30, 2024","Comment A North Korean hacking group earlier in August exploited a previously unknown bug in Chrome-based browsers to target organizations with the goal of stealing cryptocurrency, according to Microsoft. In a report published on Friday, the tech giant’s cybersecurity researchers said they first saw evidence of the hackers’ activities on August 19, and said the hackers were affiliated with a group called Citrine Sleet,which is known to target the crypto industry. According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in a core engine within Chromium, the underlying code of Chrome and other popular browsers, like Microsoft’s Edge. When the hackers exploited the vulnerability, it was a zero-day, meaning the software maker — in this case, Google — was unaware of the bug and as such had zero time to issue a fix prior to its exploitation. Google patched the bug two days later on August 21, according to Microsoft. Google’s spokesperson Scott Westover told TechCrunch that Google had no comment other than confirming that the bug was patched. Microsoft said it has notified “targeted and compromised customers,” but did not provide more information on who was targeted, nor how many targets and victims were targeted by this hacking campaign. When asked by TechCrunch, Chris Williams, a spokesperson for Microsoft, declined to say how many organizations or companies were affected. Researchers wrote that Citrine Sleet “is based in North Korea and primarily targets financial institutions, particularly organizations and individuals managing cryptocurrency, for financial gain,” and the group “has conducted extensive reconnaissance of the cryptocurrency industry and individuals associated with it” as part of its social engineering techniques. “The threat actor creates fake websites masquerading as legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and uses them to distribute fake job applications or lure targets into downloading a weaponized cryptocurrency wallet or trading application based on legitimate applications,” reads the report. “Citrine Sleet most commonly infects targets with the unique trojan malware it developed, AppleJeus, which collects information necessary to seize control of the targets’ cryptocurrency assets.” The North Korean hackers’ attack started by tricking a victim into visiting a web domain under the hackers’ control. Then, because of another vulnerability in the Windows kernel, the hackers were able to install a rootkit — a type of malware that has deep access to the operating system — on the target’s computer, according to Microsoft’s report. At that point, it’s basically game over for the targeted victim’s data, as the hackers had gained complete control of the hacked computer. Crypto has been a juicy target for North Korean government hackers for years. A United Nations Security Council panel concluded that the regimestole $3 billion in cryptobetween 2017 and 2023. Given that the Kim Jong Un government is the target of strict international sanctions, the regime has turned to stealing crypto to fund its nuclear weapons program. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Hardware,"Five months after Microsoft hired its founders, Inflection adds usage caps to Pi",https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/26/five-months-after-microsoft-hired-its-founders-inflection-adds-usage-caps-to-pi/,"7:45 AM PDT • August 26, 2024","Comment Inflection will cap free access to its AI chatbot Pi in the coming months, the startup tells TechCrunch. Users can also now export their conversations off the AI chatbot, as the new CEO shifts the company’s focus toward enterprise products. The usage caps come just a year after Inflectionraised $1.3 billionto build out the “emotionally intelligent” AI chatbot. One of the lead investors in that deal, Microsoft,hired away Inflection’s founders and most of its stafffive months ago, paying $650 million to license its AI model and repay investors. At that time, Inflection said Pi had millions of weekly users. That deal has drawnattention from antitrust regulatorsin the U.S. and U.K., who are now investigating whether Microsoft was anticompetitive when it effectively ate Inflection alive. Since then, CEO Sean White has steered the gutted startup through this difficult post-acqui-hire phase. Two weeks ago, the company was planning to sunset Pi, an Inflection spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time, which is understandable considering Inflection is more resource constrained than it once was. “We have to very carefully apply our resources,” White told TechCrunch. Those plans have since changed, and White now says the company is committed to keeping consumer Pi afloat. However, Inflection aims to reduce the strain on its GPU resources with usage caps on the free chatbot, which Inflection says will mostly affect power users. As to the details of those caps, a spokesperson told TechCrunch that the “exact limits are still being determined.” Inflection is also giving users a chance to move any important conversations with Pi off the chatbot. It’s partnering with the Data Transfers Initiative to allow users to export their conversations off of Pi, or theoretically import conversations from other chatbots. White sees Inflection as setting a new standard for the AI industry in data mobility and transferability, hoping other companies will follow suit. Because Inflection is the first to make such a move, users can’t actually import their conversations with Pi to ChatGPT or any other chatbots; they can just take them off of Pi. The path forward for Inflection may be in licensing AI models for companies to build into their own systems. White said 13,000 organizations have filled out an application showing interest in gaining API access to Pi. “Honestly, we don’t have all the resources to deal with 13,000 requests, and so we’ve had to be fairly selective in who we start to work with,” said White. He added that the company has held meetings with large banks, insurers and several Fortune 500 companies about potentially using its enterprise products. White claims Inflection’s fine-tuning infrastructure allows it to customize AI models to specific organizations better than competitors. He hopes to announce the first enterprise products and partnerships in the fall. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Hardware,This new accessible Xbox nunchuk controller has 3D-printable joystick parts,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/21/this-new-accessible-xbox-nunchuck-controller-has-3d-printable-joystick-parts/,"2:49 PM PDT • August 21, 2024","Comment Microsoft demonstrated its leadership in accessible gaming hardware again on Wednesday with the announcement of a new one-handed joystick controller for Xbox and PC.The Xbox Adaptive Joystickworks with the company’s already robust accessibility hardware stack, and even includes support for custom 3D-printed parts. The Adaptive series of devices and controllershas been around for years, and Microsoft has consistently worked with the accessibility community to find out what’s needed and updated accordingly. In this case, it’s a straightforward one-handed “nunchuk,”as they were once called, though this one-handed form factor is now more common in VR setups. As the company puts it:  “Through years of research, testing and collaboration with players with disabilities, and accessibility experts, we designed the Xbox Adaptive Joystick as a wired companion to Xbox controllers, specifically for players with limited mobility. “The Xbox Adaptive Joystick’s versatility allows players to seamlessly incorporate the controller into existing gaming setups – it can be controlled with one hand, mounted via tabletops, or used with non-hand body parts.” There are other one-handed joysticks out there, but having something that works well out of the box with other gaming accessibility tools is very helpful, andthe price is right at $30. You don’t get wireless connectivity, sadly, but most accessible setups rely on wired devices anyway. One cool feature is the ability to use 3D-printed joystick “toppers” — normally a rubber or silicone disc, but not everyone can use those. Why not something taller, or wider, or thinner, or with little holes in it so you can attach a string or wire? The company rolled out a set of free, 3D-printable toppers in a range of shapes that anyone can swap in. Great, right? You can see that big one in use up top — way better for catching chin or limb movements. Microsoft also partners with other hardware makers, and showed off the coolProteus controllerthat’s been kicking around for a couple years but just recently got the VIP Xbox treatment. And there’s the 8BitDo Lite SE, specifically designed for the accessibility market, which puts all the Xbox controller buttons right on the front like an old-school arcade stick (there’s one for Switch too). I’m tempted to get one myself to give my trigger-button fingers a rest. Lastly, and a testament to the thoroughness that the Microsoft accessibility team has come to exemplify, the new joystick and indeed the latest versions of the Xbox Series X and S themselvesall have packagingthat forgoes the usual fiddly twist ties and things, making it easy for anyone with limited mobility or reach to open them up.

Hardware,"US tech giants fight Indian telcos’ bid to regulate internet services, pay for network usage",https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/us-tech-giants-fight-indian-telcos-bid-to-regulate-internet-services/,"1:12 AM PDT • August 20, 2024","Comment Global technology giants are pushing back against attempts by India’s telecom networks to bring internet services under stricter regulation, rejecting arguments that such measures are necessary to create a “level playing field” and address national security concerns. The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), a powerful industry body that represents Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix and Spotify, has forcefully argued against inclusion of the so-called over-the-top (OTT) services in theproposed regulatory framework(PDF) for telecom operators. In a submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the AIC said there are fundamental differences in technology, operations and functionality between OTT services and traditional telecom operations. OTT services operate on the application layer, while telecom service providers (TSPs) operate on the network layer. Unlike TSPs, OTT providers do not have rights to acquire spectrum, obtain numbering resources or interconnect with the public switched telephone network. “OTT communication services are not substitutes of traditional telecom services,” the AIC wrote in its submission, noting that OTT services offer additional functionalities like group chats, voice notes and in-app content sharing. Including internet services in the new framework could violate net neutrality principles and harm consumer interests, the AIC warned. “At the outset, we would like to submit that OTT communication services are already regulated under a host of laws, including as ‘intermediaries’ under the IT Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. Thus, concerns that OTT communication services operate in an ecosystem where there is no regulatory oversight are unfounded,” the AIC also stated. The coalition argues there are already enough regulations in India that oversee OTT services, including requirements for interception, content takedown, incident reporting and user grievance redressal under the IT Act and related rules. This resistance comes in response to a coordinated push by India’s top telecom operators — Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea — to bring OTT services under a new authorization framework. Jio, India’s largest telecom operator with more than 475 million subscribers, and other telco operators have recommended that OTT providerscontribute to network development costsbased on their traffic consumption, turnover and user base. The telcos’ push comes as they grapple with low average revenue per user — of approximately $2 per month. Having collectivelyinvested $19 billion in 5G airwaves last year, the carriers are seeking regulatory intervention to boost margins. The AIC disputed claims of OTT services “free-riding” on telecom infrastructure. Jeff Paine, AIC’s managing director, said that OTT services have driven increased data consumption and revenues for carriers. The AIC also argued that regulating OTT services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 would go beyond its intended scope. The coalition noted that when the Act was introduced in Parliament, the telecoms minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, clarified that “OTT has been regulated by the IT Act of 2000 and continues to be regulated by the IT Act” and also stipulated “there is no coverage of OTT in the new telecom bill passed by the Parliament.” The debate in India mirrors similar discussions in South Korea andEurope, where network operators are also pushing for contributions from large tech companies.

Google,EV startup Ather seeks to raise $370 million in India IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/ev-startup-ather-seeks-to-raise-370-million-in-india-ipo/,"2:23 AM PDT • September 9, 2024","Comment Indian electric scooter manufacturer Ather Energy plans to raise about $370 million by issuing fresh shares in an initial public offering, according to itsdraft prospectus filed on Monday(PDF), as the startup seeks to capitalize on growing demand for electric vehicles in the world’s third-largest auto market. The Bengaluru-based lossmaking startup, which competes withrecently listed rival Ola Electric, said it will also sell up to 22 million shares from existing investors in the IPO. The firm is targeting a valuation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Ather Energy declined to comment. The startup,backed by India’s Hero MotoCorpand sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, said it will use the proceeds to fund a new manufacturing facility in Maharashtra state, repay borrowings and invest in research and development. Ather Energy commanded about 19% of the electric two-wheeler market as of August-end, according to official government data. Ola Electric leads the market with a 31% share, whereas TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto hold 20% and 19% market share, respectively. Hero has about 5% of the market share. Traditional giants are increasingly ramping up their focus on the EV market — and delivering results. Bajaj Auto’s market share stood at 11% at the end of June this year, for instance, when Ola Electric had about 46% of the market. Ather’s IPO plans come as India’s electric vehicle market heats up, driven by government incentives and rising fuel prices. The country aims to have 30% of private cars and 70% of commercial vehicles running on electricity by 2030. Founded in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, Ather is known for its in-house design approach, with 80% of key components designed internally. Ather raised about $500 million across several rounds, according to Tracxn. The startup reported losing $126 million to generate a revenue of $213 million for the fiscal year ending March. Ather faces stiff competition from well-funded startups and established automakers rushing to grab a slice of India’s rapidly growing electric two-wheeler market. Rival Ola Electric went public last month, while traditional players like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor have also entered the electric scooter space. Axis Capital, HSBC, JM Financial and Nomura are book-running lead managers for Ather’s IPO. Powered byWordPress VIP"

The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterdaythat under a proposed agreement described to investors, Tesla would use xAI models in its driver-assistance software (known as Full Self-Driving or FSD). The AI startup would also help develop features such as a voice assistant in Tesla vehicles and software for Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus. Writing on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter),Musk saidhe hadn’t read the WSJ story, but he described a post summarizing the report as “not accurate.” “Tesla has learned a lot from discussions with engineers at xAI that have helped accelerate achieving unsupervised FSD, but there is no need to license anything from xAI,” he wrote. “The xAI models are gigantic, containing, in compressed form, most of human knowledge, and couldn’t possibly run on the Tesla vehicle inference computer, nor would we want them to.” Musk founded xAI as a competitor to OpenAI (which he co-founded but eventually left).TechCrunch reported earlier this yearthat as part of the pitch forxAI’s $6 billion funding round, the startup outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies (Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X), and its models could then improve technology across those companies. Tesla shareholders have sued Muskover the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing company. Powered byWordPress VIP"

But that’s not quite true. A startup calledThunder Power Holdingswent public on the Nasdaq exchange in June through a SPAC, and is now trying to raise up to $100 million more through ashare sale deal. All this is happening even as the CEO of the company, Wellen Sham, has been indicted by the Taiwanese government on 11 criminal charges. It’s all right there in Thunder Power’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are required for all public companies. Thunder Power spells it out on page 46 of thisamended S-4 filingfrom April, where it explains that the Taipei District Prosecutor’s Office brought charges against Sham in 2022. The case is now before Taipei’s District Court Criminal Division. Sham is accused of a number of securities-related violations related to Electric Power Technology Limited, another company where he’s chairman. It has some connections to Thunder Power. Sham owns roughly 75% of Thunder Power’s stock post-merger, and Electric Powerholdssome of those shares. Sham is accused of using Electric Power resources to pay for a “seminar hosted by Thunder Power.” He’s also accused of giving “instructions to issue a false press release with the aim of disseminating rumors or misleading information.” Following the criminal charges, Taiwan’s Securities Investor and Futures Trader Protection Center has asked for Sham to be dismissed from his chairman position at Electric Power. Thunder Power’s filings say that Sham has claimed he is innocent. The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Thunder Power is, perhaps surprisingly, not a new company. It’s been around in some form as far back as 2015, when it showed up at the Frankfurt Motor Show and Sham toldTop Gear magazinethat the company was “finished [with] the concept phase” and had moved into the “homologation process.” Last year, though, in preparation for the SPAC merger, Thunder Poweradmittedon page 31 of its initial S-4 filing that it “has not produced a single electric vehicle.” That was still true in May of this year, according toanotheramended S-4 filing. At that time, Thunder Power says the only vehicles that exist are prototypes built by a Tonggao Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Taicang) Co. Ltd., an affiliate based in China. Thunder Power has lost more than $35 million since its inception andsaysit has “no revenue.” It had just $921,349 in cash as of June 30, 2024. After going public in June, Thunder Powerstrucka financial deal with Westwood Capital Group LLC, a New York firm that bills itself as an “investment bank delivering creative solutions to clients with complex financial needs.” The deal allows Thunder Power to sell up to around $100 million worth of shares to Westwood, which the firm can then turn around and sell on the open market — similar to the many deals that New Jersey-based Yorkville Advisorshas struck with EV startupsand other companies that merged with SPACs. Westwood has already been paid with $1.5 million worth of Thunder Power shares for entering into the agreement, though Thunder Power said in afilingthis week that it has not yet sold any more shares to the firm. One caveat, however: Thunder Power can’t force Westwood to buy additional shares if the share price is below $1 prior to February 20, 2025, or lower than $1.50 per share after that date. Right now,shares are trading at less than $0.50.  Powered byWordPress VIP"

TfL, which runs the London Underground (known as the Tube), buses and trams across London, said that while the city’s public transit system is “operating as usual,” several customer-facing systems are offline, including some ticketing systems and its online real-time Tube arrival information. Details of the incident remain scarce. TfL disclosed the cyberattack on September 2, and said that it took action to “prevent further access to its systems.” In abrief update on its websiteon Friday, TfL said it has no evidence yet that any customer data was compromised in the cyberattack. TfL spokesperson Princess Mills declined to answer TechCrunch’s specific questions about the incident, including what evidence, such as logs, the organization has to determine if any data was stolen. TfL also declined to make the executive who oversees cybersecurity available for an interview. In a brief statement attributed to TfL’s chief technology officer Shashi Verma, the transport network confirmed it “identified some suspicious activity on Sunday and took action to limit access.” According to the cyber incident page as of Friday, TfL says, “many of our staff have limited access to systems and email and, as a result, we may be delayed or unable to respond to your query or any webforms previously submitted.” According tosources speaking to BBC News, TfL employees have been told to work from home, as much of the organization’s back-office systems at its headquarters are affected. A review by TechCrunch of TfL’s public-facing web infrastructure shows much of the organization’s systems are no longer online, or have been restricted from accessing the public internet, likely in an effort to isolate the intruders and prevent further access. At the time of writing, TechCrunch found several TfL systems, including its employee log-on portal, were still accessible from the internet. Updated with post-publish comment from TfL.

Small startup world side note: Some of the tech buried in Vay’s teleoperated Kia Niro vehicles comes from Polysync Technologies, a now-defunct startup out of Portland that I discovered waaaayyyy back at the firstself-racing car eventat Thunderhill Raceway in 2016. I spent a few days in the2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV2LT, and I am happy to report that the software worked! And no, this isn’t snark; last year,GMexperienced what one employee recently described to me as a “centennial moment” when it rolled out the Chevrolet Blazer EV and it was plagued by buggy software that left oneauto reporter stranded. The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV 2LT, which is front-wheel drive and comes with an 85 kilowatt-hour battery that provides an estimated 319 miles of range, has a suggested retail price of $45,995 (including the destination fee). My version also included the hands-free advanced driver-assistance system known as Super Cruise. I was skeptical after my experience with the Blazer EV, which left me a bit meh. The Equinox EV is not the Blazer. It’s simply a better EV — and yes, even without Apple CarPlay. There were a few extra steps to ensure you’ll have the same digital experience as the smartphone mirroring  CarPlay and Android Auto products provide. And that might turn off some folks. But once I checked all the checks and toggled all the right toggles, I had a seamless experience. One odd item of note: Super Cruise was initiating automatic lane changes on the highway, but by my second day behind the wheel (and on the same stretch of highway), I had to manually move the vehicle into the lane. What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.

Microsoft,Public EV startup with an indicted CEO is looking to raise an additional $100 million,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/public-ev-startup-with-an-indicted-ceo-is-looking-to-raise-an-additional-100-million/,"9:25 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment It’s tempting to think the trend of EV startups merging with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) to go public has ended, seeing how many of them are struggling ordefunct. But that’s not quite true. A startup calledThunder Power Holdingswent public on the Nasdaq exchange in June through a SPAC, and is now trying to raise up to $100 million more through ashare sale deal. All this is happening even as the CEO of the company, Wellen Sham, has been indicted by the Taiwanese government on 11 criminal charges. It’s all right there in Thunder Power’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are required for all public companies. Thunder Power spells it out on page 46 of thisamended S-4 filingfrom April, where it explains that the Taipei District Prosecutor’s Office brought charges against Sham in 2022. The case is now before Taipei’s District Court Criminal Division. Sham is accused of a number of securities-related violations related to Electric Power Technology Limited, another company where he’s chairman. It has some connections to Thunder Power. Sham owns roughly 75% of Thunder Power’s stock post-merger, and Electric Powerholdssome of those shares. Sham is accused of using Electric Power resources to pay for a “seminar hosted by Thunder Power.” He’s also accused of giving “instructions to issue a false press release with the aim of disseminating rumors or misleading information.” Following the criminal charges, Taiwan’s Securities Investor and Futures Trader Protection Center has asked for Sham to be dismissed from his chairman position at Electric Power. Thunder Power’s filings say that Sham has claimed he is innocent. The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Thunder Power is, perhaps surprisingly, not a new company. It’s been around in some form as far back as 2015, when it showed up at the Frankfurt Motor Show and Sham toldTop Gear magazinethat the company was “finished [with] the concept phase” and had moved into the “homologation process.” Last year, though, in preparation for the SPAC merger, Thunder Poweradmittedon page 31 of its initial S-4 filing that it “has not produced a single electric vehicle.” That was still true in May of this year, according toanotheramended S-4 filing. At that time, Thunder Power says the only vehicles that exist are prototypes built by a Tonggao Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Taicang) Co. Ltd., an affiliate based in China. Thunder Power has lost more than $35 million since its inception andsaysit has “no revenue.” It had just $921,349 in cash as of June 30, 2024. After going public in June, Thunder Powerstrucka financial deal with Westwood Capital Group LLC, a New York firm that bills itself as an “investment bank delivering creative solutions to clients with complex financial needs.” The deal allows Thunder Power to sell up to around $100 million worth of shares to Westwood, which the firm can then turn around and sell on the open market — similar to the many deals that New Jersey-based Yorkville Advisorshas struck with EV startupsand other companies that merged with SPACs. Westwood has already been paid with $1.5 million worth of Thunder Power shares for entering into the agreement, though Thunder Power said in afilingthis week that it has not yet sold any more shares to the firm. One caveat, however: Thunder Power can’t force Westwood to buy additional shares if the share price is below $1 prior to February 20, 2025, or lower than $1.50 per share after that date. Right now,shares are trading at less than $0.50.  Powered byWordPress VIP"
Microsoft,Driverless car-sharing startup Vay steers toward B2B services,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/driverless-car-sharing-startup-vay-steers-towards-b2b-services/,"10:49 AM PDT • September 5, 2024","Comment Vay, a startup that has put a teleoperated twist to car-sharing in Berlin and Las Vegas, is expanding into commercial and business-to-business services buoyed by recent deals with French automaker Peugeot and Belgium-based Poppy. Vayisn’t a traditional ride-hailing or car-sharing startup, nor does it operate a robotaxi service. And yet, when customers in Las Vegas or Berlin open the Vay app and hail a car, it arrives without a human behind the wheel. The Berlin-based startup, which was founded in 2019 and has raised about $110 million to date, has developed teleoperations technology that allows employees sitting in an office to pilot empty vehicles to customers. Once the Vay vehicle arrives, the customer hops in and takes over manual control of the car. Customers drive themselves to their destination. Once they’re finished, the teleops driver pilots the vehicle back. The new business-to-business division is a bet on what co-founder and CEO Thomas von der Ohe thinks is the future of mobility, he told TechCrunch. “This is what we predict the future of vehicles will look like,” he said. “You just click a button, you get a van or truck or private vehicle to be teledrive-enabled.” Von der Ohe said that tele-driving technology is so inexpensive from a capital expenditure perspective, he expects that within five to 10 years, any kind of vehicle that runs from the production line will be teleop-enabled, leveraging the ADAS cameras that are already on the vehicle. It’s here where Vay hopes to carve out deals and market share. The expansion, led by a task force within the firm’s business development team headed up by Chief Business Officer Justin Spratt, aims to be an AWS of sorts for vehicle fleets. That means Vay would supply the teledriving platform for automakers, car share and rental firms, trucking, luxury / telechauffeuring, and delivery and logistics. The company has already landed two deals. Earlier this year, Vay announced a partnership with Peugeot to test how an E-308 electric van equipped with tele-driving technology could work. Vay is also exploring use cases for the luxury OEM market. The company says this could include telechauffeuring, where vehicle owners can drive themselves to a social event before being comfortably teledriven home. Vay also landed a deal with Belgium car-sharing company Poppy to test its teleops technology on its fleet. Von der Ohe said other high-profile customers will be announced soon. From von der Ohe’s perspective, Vay is creating a new mobility category designed for customers who want flexibility and to avoid the hassle of parking a vehicle. That is a niche group, but von der Ohe contends the startup has some traction. Vay launched in Las Vegas earlier this year with two Kia Niro EVs. Since then, the startup has expanded to 15 vehicles and expanded its operating area to encompass about 25% of Las Vegas, including parts of North Las Vegas and Spring Hill. Vay has completed 3,000 trips in Vegas since launching in January 2024 and is growing 20% month over month. The results have been positive enough that Vay is now investing in a larger fleet with plans to have 100 vehicles in the next six to nine months, von der Ohe said. Price has been a key driver of those results. Von der Ohe said Vay guarantees that its driverless car-sharing trips are half the price of a ride-hailing trip offered by Uber and Lyft. That price guarantee has helped it attract repeat customers — many of whom are local residents and commuters. That competitive pricing has cut into its bottom line, however.Von der Ohe said the company can reach profitability by scaling — and notably without having thousands of vehicles in its fleet. He also said they can tweak the price to reach profitability faster, although for now that is not the plan. “We’d love to keep that claim of 50% cheaper than ride hailing, but we wouldn’t have to if we decide to focus everything on profitability,” he said. “We believe that just 20% or 30% cheaper than the next best alternative would be sufficient value proposition to the customer.” Powered byWordPress VIP"

Microsoft,Polestar is getting a new CEO amid EV sales slump,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/polestar-is-getting-a-new-ceo-amid-ev-sales-slump/,"10:39 AM PDT • August 28, 2024","Comment Just weeks ago,during an interview with TechCrunch, Thomas Ingenlath laid out his plan to turn Polestar into a self-sustaining company. Now, he’s out. Polestar said Tuesday Ingenlath hasresigned as CEO, a position he has held since the EV startup spun out of Volvo in 2017. He will be replaced by Michael Lohscheller, who was previously CEO of the Stellantis brand Opel, as well as VinFast and Nikola. The executive shakeup comes at a precarious time for Polestar, which has undergone layoffs and other cost-cutting measures over the past year. The company, which is now publicly traded, is attempting to bring several new EVs to market even as it experiences slower sales growth. Earlier this year, Volvo divested a significant portion of its holdings. Polestar has since turned to banks for a$1 billion loan, critical funds needed to keep its EV plans moving ahead.

Microsoft,Tesla’s Supercharger network is still unavailable to non-Tesla EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/teslas-supercharging-network-is-still-unavailable-to-non-tesla-evs/,"9:12 AM PDT • August 28, 2024","Comment It’s been more than a year since Tesla agreed to open its Supercharger network to electric vehicles from other automakers, likeGeneral Motors and Ford.

Transportation,Meta Llama: Everything you need to know about the open generative AI model,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/meta-llama-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-open-generative-ai-model/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 8, 2024","Comment Like every big tech company these days, Meta has its own flagship generative AI model, calledLlama. Llama is somewhat unique among major models in that it’s “open,” meaning developers can download and use it however they please (with certain limitations). That’s in contrast to models like Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’sGPT-4o(which powersChatGPT) andGoogle’s Gemini, which can only be accessed via APIs. In the interest of giving developers choice, however, Meta has also partnered with vendors including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to make cloud-hosted versions of Llama available. In addition, the company has released tools designed to make it easier to fine-tune and customize the model. Here’s everything you need to know about Llama, from its capabilities and editions to where you can use it. We’ll keep this post updated as Meta releases upgrades and introduces new dev tools to support the model’s use. Llama is a family of models — not just one: The latest versions areLlama 3.1 8B,Llama 3.1 70BandLlama 3.1 405B, which was releasedin July 2024. They’re trained on web pages in a variety of languages, public code and files on the web, as well as synthetic data (i.e. data generated by other AI models). Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are small, compact models meant to run on devices ranging from laptops to servers. Llama 3.1 405B, on the other hand, is a large-scale model requiring (absent some modifications) data center hardware. Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B are less capable than Llama 3.1 405B, but faster. They’re “distilled” versions of 405B, in point of fact, optimized for low storage overhead and latency. All the Llama models have 128,000-token context windows. (In data science, tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables “fan,” “tas” and “tic” in the word “fantastic.”) A model’s context, or context window, refers to input data (e.g. text) that the model considers before generating output (e.g. additional text). Long context can prevent models from “forgetting” the content of recent docs and data, and from veering off topic and extrapolating wrongly. Those 128,000 tokens translate to around 100,000 words or 300 pages, which for reference is around the length of “Wuthering Heights,” “Gulliver’s Travels” and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Like other generative AI models, Llama can perform a range of different assistive tasks, like coding and answering basic math questions, as well as summarizing documents in eight languages (English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish and Thai). Most text-based workloads — think analyzing files like PDFs and spreadsheets — are within its purview; none of the Llama models can process or generate images, although that maychangein the near future. All the latest Llama models can be configured to leverage third-party apps, tools and APIs to complete tasks. They’re trained out of the box to use Brave Search to answer questions about recent events, the Wolfram Alpha API for math- and science-related queries and a Python interpreter for validating code. In addition, Meta says the Llama 3.1 models can use certain tools they haven’t seen before (but whether they canreliablyuse those tools is another matter). If you’re looking to simply chat with Llama, it’spowering the Meta AI chatbot experienceon Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus and Meta.ai. Developers building with Llama can download, use or fine-tune the model across most of the popular cloud platforms. Meta claims it has over 25 partners hosting Llama, including Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell and Snowflake. Some of these partners have built additional tools and services on top of Llama, including tools that let the models reference proprietary data and enable them to run at lower latencies. Meta suggests using its smaller models, Llama 8B and Llama 70B, for general-purpose applications like powering chatbots and generating code. Llama 405B, the company says, is better reserved for model distillation — the process of transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller, more efficient model — and generating synthetic data to train (or fine-tune) alternative models. Importantly, the Llama licenseconstrains how developers can deploy the model: App developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta that the company will grant on its discretion. Alongside Llama, Meta provides tools intended to make the model “safer” to use: Llama Guard tries to detect potentially problematic content either fed into — or generated — by a Llama model, including content relating to criminal activity, child exploitation, copyright violations, hate, self-harm and sexual abuse. Developers cancustomizethe categories of blocked content, and apply the blocks to all the languages Llama supports out of the box. Like Llama Guard, Prompt Guard can block text intended for Llama, but only text meant to “attack” the model and get it to behave in undesirable ways. Meta claims that Llama Guard can defend against explicitly malicious prompts (i.e. jailbreaks that attempt to get around Llama’s built-in safety filters) in addition to prompts that contain “injected inputs.” As for CyberSecEval, it’s less a tool than a collection of benchmarks to measure model security. CyberSecEval can assess the risk a Llama model poses (at least according to Meta’s criteria) to app developers and end users in areas like “automated social engineering” and “scaling offensive cyber operations.” Llama comes with certain risks and limitations, like all generative AI models. For instance, it’s unclear whether Meta trained Llama on copyrighted content. If it did, users might be liable for infringement if they end up unwittingly using acopyrighted snippet that the model regurgitated. Meta at one pointused copyrighted e-books for AI trainingdespite its own lawyers’ warnings, according to recent reporting by Reuters. The company controversially trains its AI on Instagram and Facebook posts, photos and captions, andmakes it difficult for users to opt out. What’s more, Meta, along with OpenAI, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit brought by authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, over the companies’ alleged unauthorized use of copyrighted data for model training. Programming is another area where it’s wise to tread lightly when using Llama. That’s because Llama might — like its generative AI counterparts —produce buggy or insecure code. As always, it’s best to have a human expert review any AI-generated code before incorporating it into a service or software. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Transportation,Meta will let third-party apps place calls to WhatsApp and Messenger users — in 2027,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/meta-will-let-third-party-apps-place-calls-to-whatsapp-and-messenger-users-in-2027/,"10:53 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Meta on Friday published an update on how it plans to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European law that aims to promote competition in digital marketplaces, where the law concerns the company’s messaging apps, Messenger and WhatsApp. As Meta notes in ablog post, the DMA requires that it provide an option in WhatsApp and Messenger to connect with interoperable third-party messaging services and apps. Meta says it’s building notifications into WhatsApp and Messenger to inform users about these third-party integrations and alert them when a newly compatible third-party messaging app comes online. The company also says it’s introducing an onboarding flow in WhatsApp and Messenger where users can learn more about third-party chats and switch them on. From the flow, users will be able to set up a designated folder for third-party messages or, alternatively, opt for a combined inbox. In 2025, Meta will roll out group functionality for third-party chats, and, in 2027, it’ll launch voice and video calling in accordance with the DMA. And at some unspecified point in the future, Meta will bring “rich messaging” features for third-party chats to WhatsApp and Messenger, like reactions, direct replies, typing indicators and read receipts, the company says. “We will keep collaborating with third-party messaging services in order to provide the safest and best experience,” Meta wrote in the post. “Users will start to see the third-party chat option when a third-party messaging service has built, tested and launched the necessary technology to make the feature a positive and secure user experience.” The upcoming WhatsApp and Messenger interoperability features aren’t a slam dunk necessarily. As we’ve reportedpreviously, it’s not clear whether other major messaging operators, such as Viber and Telegram, will support them. WhatsApp will require end-to-end encryption to enable interoperability, which could also present technical roadblocks. Plus, Meta requires that companies sign an agreement — the details of which were only relatively recently made public — to integrate with any of its systems. Open source messaging protocol Matrix’s founder Matthew Hodgson, for one, noted in a talk this year that Matrix will work with WhatsApp, end-to-end encryption intact, “on an experimental basis.” Meta is attempting to meet its obligations under the DMA’s messaging-related clauses, but the company has come under fire for allegedly violating other components of the legislation. This summer, the European Commission said that Meta’s “pay or consent” ad model, which offers EU users of Facebook and Instagram a choice between a paid, ad-free experience or a free, ad-supported version, failed to comply with the DMA.

Transportation,"Instagram jazzes up its DMs with stickers, photo editing, and themes",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/instagram-is-adding-new-photo-editing-features-to-dms/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Meta-owned Instagram is jazzing up the inbox by adding new features for photo editing, sticker creation and themes. The company is trying to make Instagram more appealing as a messaging app with features to make conversations more engaging. While some of these features might not sound new, it’s all about removing friction for users that might prevent them from sending a message. In addition, the inbox — or DMs (direct messages) — are a competitive feature for social apps, including Meta’s Threads, which is taking on Twitter/X. While other startups like Bluesky are integrating DMs directly into their app, Threads is still relying on Instagram’s existing DMs for those who want to connect privately. With today’s release of new features, Instagram users will gain access to a sticker maker in the direct messages interface. Here, you’ll be able to take a photo from the library and use a cutout of an object to create a reaction sticker. Earlier this year, WhatsApp gaineda similar tool for creating stickers. Plus, you can use theiPhone’s own toolto make stickers that you can use across the apps. Instagram will also let you add stickers or draw over a photo before sending it to a friend. These tools were previously available in the Stories composer, so if you wanted to send an image with stickers or scribbles, you had to save that photo and then send it through a DM. Now, you’ll be able to apply these edits directly within the chat interface. Another new feature will allow users to post a note on their own birthday so their friends can wish them a happy birthday. When they tap on the note, they will see a cake effect and confetti animation on the screen. Celebrating birthdays has been a feature that makes Facebook sticky, even after all these years, so making birthday celebrations a bigger part of Instagram could help keep users engaged with the app, despite the growing competition from TikTok and others. Similar to other messaging apps, Instagram will also introduce new themes for chat, such as “Fall” and “Sabrina Carpenter.” Earlier this week, Instagram addeda new feature that lets users comment on Stories, which is also designed to increase engagement.

This rapid growth led some users to encounter the occasional error that would state there were “Not Enough Resources” to handle requests, as Bluesky engineers scrambled to keep the servers stable under the influx of new sign-ups. As new users downloaded the app, Bluesky jumped to becoming the No. 1 app in Brazil over the weekend, ahead of Meta’s X competitor,Instagram Threads. According to app intelligence firmAppfigures, Bluesky’s total downloads soared by 10,584% this weekend compared to last, and its downloads in Brazil were up by a whopping 1,018,952%. The growth seems to be having a halo effect, as downloads outside Brazil also rose by 584%, the firm noted. In part, this is due to Bluesky receiving downloads in 22 countries where it had barely seen any traction before. In terms of absolute downloads, countries that saw the most installs outside Brazil included the U.S., Portugal, the U.K., Canada and Spain. Those with the most download growth, however, were Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Romania. Most of the latter group jumped from single-digit growth to growth in the thousands. Bluesky’s newcomers have actively engaged on the platform, too, driving up other key metrics. As one Bluesky engineerremarked, the number of likes on the social network grew to 104.6 million over the past four-day period, up from just 13 million when compared with a similar period just a week ago. Follows also grew from 1.4 million to 100.8 million while reposts grew from 1.3 million to 11 million. As of Monday, Bluesky said it had added 2.11 million users during the past four days, up from 26,000 users it had added in the week-ago period. In addition, the companynotedit had seen “significantly more than a 100% [daily active users] increase.” On Tuesday, Bluesky told TechCrunch the number is now 2.4 million and continues to grow “by the minute.” The following day (after publication), Blueskyannouncedthe figure had reached 2.6 million-plus, over 85% of which are Brazilian. Bluesky’s appeal to those forced to leave X may have to do with how closely the user experience resembles that of the now Elon Musk-owned app, formerly known as Twitter. Once incubated within Twitter, Bluesky spun out as a separate company andraised its own funding, but still retains much of Twitter’s look and feel. Like X, Bluesky offers features like likes, reposts, quote posts, lists,direct messages, search tools and user profiles, but it also improves on X’s capabilities in other ways. As a decentralized social network, users canset up their own instances(servers that run Bluesky and connect to others over the AT Protocol),customize their feeds, subscribe tothird-party moderation servicesand create and share “starter packs” that link tocurated sets of recommended usersto follow. In a coming update, Bluesky also plans to add support for video, the company says. Another factor to consider here is how Bluesky’s approach to content and moderation differs from Threads. Even when it was Twitter, X has long been known as a hotbed for breaking news and political debates. Threads has taken the opposite approach, saying it wouldnot default to recommending political contenton its platform. Instead, Threads wants to make itself palatable to brands and influencers, similar to Instagram, asit intends to eventually monetize via ads. Given thatX’s ban in Brazilis tied to politics — the country wanted control over what could be said on the platform — it’s likely that some Brazilians opting for Bluesky wanted to join a network that was not centralized and as easily controlled. On platforms like X, moderation decisions are left up to the site’s owners, but on decentralized networks, the users are in charge. That flexibility, combined with Bluesky’s ease of use, could make the network a bigger draw than others. For instance, though Mastodon offers its own decentralized network, the recent user growth driven by Brazil was on a much smaller scale. On Saturday, Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochkosaidthe service had seen 4,200 signups from Brazil, up from 152 signups on August 28, for instance. That could speak to the fact that Brazilians want more than decentralization: They also want a place that more closely resembles Twitter/X. Meta has not yet commented on how large an increase it’s seen on Threads driven by Brazilians leaving X, but as a network that already has over200 million monthly active users,even the addition of thousands or millions would not be as noticeable a gain, compared with the much smaller Bluesky. Still, it’s also possible that Brazilians wanted to move to a place that was separate from friends, family and creators — one that defaulted to public postings and felt more like Twitter once did.

Transportation,a16z’s Joshua Lu says AI is already radically changing video games and Discord is the future,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/02/a16zs-joshua-lu-says-ai-is-already-radically-changing-video-games-and-discord-is-the-future/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 2, 2024","Comment Andreessen Horowitz’s partner Joshua Lu knows that, in the video game industry, you can never get too comfortable. When he was head of product at Zynga, he experienced the height of mobile games, working on hits like Words with Friends; then as a vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, he helped produce tentpole hits like Diablo Immortal. And then, as a director of product management at Meta, he learned to see games in new dimensions while working on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. “I had to forget what I thought were universal truths and learn a whole new set of ways to do things,” Lu told TechCrunch. Now Lu wants a front-row seat to where video games are heading. After joining the firm as an investor in 2022, Lu helped launch the firm’s Speedrun accelerator, which invests $750,000 apiece into about 40 gaming startups twice a year. Now on the firm’s third cohort — with the applications for the fourth cohort now open — Lu said he’s seen how AI and new distribution platforms are changing the industry. Half of the accelerator’s current batch are AI companies, doing everything from creating AI-crafted stories to using AI for 3D avatars. “The last game that I worked on at Blizzard took six years and a $250 million budget to ship,” he said, referring to Diablo Immortal. “But wouldn’t it be so great if that kind of quality of game could be done with a 10th of the budget and a 10th of the people?” We might quibble with how great it is for AI to kill high-paying developer jobs at the largest game companies. But if AI also helps more startups form and be qualitatively competitive, that’s a compelling thought. Lu says he’s seen firsthand how companies are getting creative, citingClementine, a startup that went through Speedrun. The company “released a demo where you had to solve a mystery by talking to AI and making sure that they didn’t find out that you were a human,” he said. That may be a terrifying premise, or a tongue-in-cheek one, depending on how existential a threat you think AI could become. Lu also mentioned Echo Chunk, a company that raised $1.4 million in a round led by Speedrun. Echo Chunk went viral for its gameEcho Chessthat uses AI to instantly generate an endless number of levels. “These are all fairly early explorations,” he said. “But we’re excited in general about novel types of game design interactions and game dynamics that can be unlocked because of AI.” Lu is also advocating for startups to build games atop Discord.Earlier this year,Discord made it so developers can create apps for people to use within the chatting platform. Lu said that, over the course of his career, he’s seen the places for people to discover games dwindle; for example, no one finds games through social media feeds anymore, like many did with FarmVille. “Where can we find the next platform where truly social games can be created and distributed?” Lu said. Several companies entered the accelerator building within Discord. Lu said several more pivoted to building in Discord over the course of the 12 weeks. “There are more games being made than ever, and it’s hard for developers to stand out,” he said. He hopes building on Discord will help “people to find pieces of content that they would really like playing.” Powered byWordPress VIP"

EVs,"Instagram jazzes up its DMs with stickers, photo editing, and themes",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/instagram-is-adding-new-photo-editing-features-to-dms/,"8:00 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Meta-owned Instagram is jazzing up the inbox by adding new features for photo editing, sticker creation and themes. The company is trying to make Instagram more appealing as a messaging app with features to make conversations more engaging. While some of these features might not sound new, it’s all about removing friction for users that might prevent them from sending a message. In addition, the inbox — or DMs (direct messages) — are a competitive feature for social apps, including Meta’s Threads, which is taking on Twitter/X. While other startups like Bluesky are integrating DMs directly into their app, Threads is still relying on Instagram’s existing DMs for those who want to connect privately. With today’s release of new features, Instagram users will gain access to a sticker maker in the direct messages interface. Here, you’ll be able to take a photo from the library and use a cutout of an object to create a reaction sticker. Earlier this year, WhatsApp gaineda similar tool for creating stickers. Plus, you can use theiPhone’s own toolto make stickers that you can use across the apps. Instagram will also let you add stickers or draw over a photo before sending it to a friend. These tools were previously available in the Stories composer, so if you wanted to send an image with stickers or scribbles, you had to save that photo and then send it through a DM. Now, you’ll be able to apply these edits directly within the chat interface. Another new feature will allow users to post a note on their own birthday so their friends can wish them a happy birthday. When they tap on the note, they will see a cake effect and confetti animation on the screen. Celebrating birthdays has been a feature that makes Facebook sticky, even after all these years, so making birthday celebrations a bigger part of Instagram could help keep users engaged with the app, despite the growing competition from TikTok and others. Similar to other messaging apps, Instagram will also introduce new themes for chat, such as “Fall” and “Sabrina Carpenter.” Earlier this week, Instagram addeda new feature that lets users comment on Stories, which is also designed to increase engagement.

EVs,"As more Instagram users engage with Stories, the app adds a comments feature",https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/03/instagram-stories-public-comments-feature/,"9:39 AM PDT • September 3, 2024","Comment Instagram’s latest feature aims to boost user interaction within Stories. The social media platform now allows followers to comment on each other’s Stories, making the experience more community-focused, akin to livestreaming where users can engage in larger discussions. A few users have already spotted the feature, including marketing strategistTaylor Loren(@taylor.loren on Threads). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a screenshot in the company’s Channel (see below). Instagram notes that users will be able to disable the option to have comments posted on their Stories, if they prefer. The new feature seems to have been inspired by user behavior. Instagram head,Adam Mosseri, has previously expressed how the Stories format is one of the app’s most popular features and is more widely used than posting content to the main feed. Private messaging is also highly favored by many users who prefer engaging in closed groups with their friends. The addition of public comments to Stories is part of Instagram’s ongoing efforts to increase engagement on the platform. Most recently, the companyaddedthe ability to add music to profiles. There’s also a new feature called“Reveal”that allows users to hide Stories so that followers can only see them after sending a DM. Powered byWordPress VIP"
EVs,Meta and Spotify spotted developing a new social music-sharing feature,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/meta-and-spotify-spotted-developing-a-new-social-music-sharing-feature/,"1:40 PM PDT • August 27, 2024","Comment Meta and Spotify are exploring deeper music integration in Meta’s Instagram app. New findings indicate the companies are testing a feature that would allow users to continuously share what music they’re listening to through Instagram’s Notes. The new functionality was first spotted by reverse engineerAlessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. However, companies like Meta and Spotify test new concepts all the time, so the discovery doesn’t necessarily mean the feature will launch to the public in the near future. In a screenshot Paluzzi published on Meta’sThreads, he shows a new option that would allow someone to “continuously share” their music from Spotify, as opposed to selecting a song from Instagram’s catalog. “You can stop sharing at any time,” the message also indicates. If it launches, the addition would build on a development launched a little over a year ago, when Instagram added the ability toshare 30-second song clips to Notes. Introducedin 2022, Notes allow Instagram users to share their status or other quick updates in a message that appears right above their Instagram inbox. The song clips feature in Notes has been supported in all markets worldwide where Instagram has music licensing rights, the company said at the time of its introduction. A partnership with Spotify could automate these sorts of song postings, providing Instagram with content even when its users were actively engaged with another app. The feature is reminiscent of the social networking activity that’s currently available within Spotify’s app. Today, Spotify allows users to “connect with Facebook” to see what friends are streaming in a separate tab on its desktop app. Spotify has alsotested a Community featurethat would allow users to see in real-time what others were streaming on mobile, although that has yet to launch. Although Spotify has continued to add more social features over time, most recently withcommenting on podcastsandricheruserprofiles, the company understands that music discovery still often takes place on dedicated social networking apps where people have built their friend networks and more regularly check in. There have been other indications of a Meta-Spotify tie-up, too. TechnologistChris Messinatold TechCrunch that at some point over the past several weeks, Instagram had added a “SpotifyiOS.framework” component to its app. He estimated this was around the release of Instagram version v.338.0 over a month ago. Earlier, Messina had pointed toanother featurethat would allow Instagram users to add music to their profile ahead of theofficial launch of the feature last week in collaborationwith singer Sabrina Carpenter. Messina theorized that Instagram could eventually integrate the offering with Spotify to better challenge TikTok on music discovery. Meta and Spotify are no strangers to working together on music features. In 2021, they teamed up onmusic initiativesthat included aminiplayer on Facebook that streamed Spotifydirectly from the app. The companies also now share a common enemy in Apple. Both Spotify and Meta believe that Apple’s App Store monopoly prevents them from managing their own in-app payments and handling their own app distribution, instead requiring them to share their app revenue with Apple via commissions on in-app purchases. Plus, Apple’s addition of a privacy feature calledATT, or app tracking transparency,hurtMeta’sads business, while Apple Music is a direct competitor with Spotify. Spotify and Meta did not respond to requests for comment.  Powered byWordPress VIP"
EVs,How to tell if your online accounts have been hacked,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/26/how-to-tell-if-your-online-accounts-have-been-hacked/,"4:30 AM PDT • August 26, 2024","Comment More and more hackers are targeting regular people with the goal of stealing their crypto, perhaps getting into their bank accountsor simply stalking them. These types of attacks are still relatively rare, so there’s no need for alarm. But it’s important to know what you can do to protect yourself if you suspect someone got into your email or social media account. A few years ago,I wrote a guideto help people protect themselves, and understand that most of the companies you have an account with already offer you tools to take control of your accounts’ security, even before you contact them for help, which in some cases you still should do. Here we break down what you can do on several different online services. Just like in the previous guide, there’s an important caveat. You should know that these methods don’t guarantee that you haven’t been compromised. If you still aren’t sure, you should contact a professional, especially if you are a journalist, a dissident or activist, or otherwise someone who has a higher risk of being targeted. In those cases, the nonprofit Access Nowhas a digital security helplinethat will connect you to one of their experts. Another caveat, if you don’t do this already, youshould enable multi-factor authenticationon all your accounts, or at least the most important ones (email, banking, social media).This directory is a great resourcethat teaches you how to enable multi-factor authentication on more than 1,000 websites. (Note that you don’t have to use the multi-factor app promoted on that site, thereareplentyof otheralternatives.) Increasingly some online services offer the use of a physical security key ora passkey stored in your password manager, which is one of the highest safeguards toprevent account intrusions that rely on password-stealing malwareor phishing. The first thing you should do if you suspect someone has broken into your Gmail account (and by extension all the other Google services linked to it) is to scroll all the way down in your inbox until you see “Last account activity” in the bottom right corner. Click on “Details.” You will then see a pop-up window that looks like this: These are all the places where your Google account is active. If you don’t recognize one of them, for example if it comes from a different location, like a country you haven’t visited recently or have never been, then click on “Security Checkup.” Here you can see on which devices your Google account is active. If you scroll down, you can also see “Recent security activity.” Check this list to see if there are any devices that you don’t recognize. If in any of these places above you see something suspicious, click on “See unfamiliar activity?” and change your password: After you change your password,as Google explains here, you will be signed out of every device in every location, except on the “devices you use to verify that it’s you when you sign in,” and some devices with third-party apps that you’ve granted account access to. If you want to sign out there too,go to this Google Support pageand click on the link to “View the apps and services with third-party access.” Finally, we also suggest considering turning onGoogle’s Advanced Protection on your account. This enhanced security protection makes phishing your password and hacking into your Google account even harder. The drawback is that you need to purchase security keys, hardware devices that serve as a second-factor. But we thinkthis methodis important and a must-use for people who are at a higher risk. Also, remember that your email account is likely linked to all your other important accounts, so getting into it could turn out to be the first step into hacking into other accounts. That’s why securing your email account is more important than virtually any other account. If you are concerned about hackers having accessed your Microsoft Outlook account, you can check “when and where you’ve signed in,” as Microsoft puts it in the account settings. To go to that page, go toyour Microsoft Account, click on Security on the left-hand menu, and then under “Sign-in activity” go to “View my activity.” At this point, you should see a page that shows recent logins, which platform and device was used to log in, the type of browser and the IP address. If something looks off, click on “Learn how to make your account more secure,” where you can change your password, check “how to recover a hacked or compromised account” and more. Microsoft also hasa support portal with information on the Recent activity page. As we noted above, your email account is the cornerstone of your online security, given that it’s likely that most of your important accounts — think social media, bank and healthcare provider, etc. — are linked to it. It’s a popular target for hackers who want to then compromise other accounts. LinkedIn has a support page detailingthe steps you can followto check if your account is logged into a device or location on the web, iOS and Android that you don’t recognize. LinkedIn hasa specific page on its websitewhere you can check the places where you are logged in. If you don’t recognize one of those sessions, click on “End” to log out of that particular session, and enter your password when prompted. If you click on “End these sessions,” you will be logged out of all the devices other than the device that you are using. On iOS and Android, the process is the same. In the LinkedIn app, tap on your profile picture on the top, tap on “Settings,” then “Sign in & Security,” then “Where you’re signed in.” At that point you will see a page that is essentially identical to the one you can see on the web. LinkedIn also has a security feature that requires you to confirm on your app if someone tries to log into another device. If you tap on the sign-in request notification, you will see a page that asks you to confirm that it was you who just attempted to login. There you can confirm the log in, or block the attempt. Like other email providers, Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch) also offers a tool to check your account and sign-in activity with the goal of allowing you to see any unusual activity that could be a sign of compromise. To access this tool, go toyour Yahoo My Account Overviewor click on the icon with your initial next to the email icon on the top right corner, and click on “Manage your account.” Once there, click on “Review recent activity.” On this page you will be able to see recent activity on your account, including password changes, phone numbers added and which devices are connected to your account, as well as their corresponding IP addresses. Given that it is likely that you have linked your email address to sensitive websites like your bank, your social media accounts and healthcare portals, among others, you should make an extra effort to secure it. Apple allows you to check which devices your Apple ID is logged in directly through the iPhone and Mac system settings,as the company explains here. On an iPhone or iPad, go to “Settings,” tap your name, and scroll down to see all the devices that you are signed in on. On a Mac, click on the Apple logo on the top left corner, then “System Settings,” then click on your name, and you will also see a list of devices, just like on an iPhone or iPad. If you click on any device, Apple says, you will be able to “view that device’s information, such as the device model, serial number” and operating system version. On Windows, you can use Apple’s iCloud app to check which devices are logged into your account. Open the app, and click on “Manage Apple ID.” There you can view the devices and get more information on them. Finally, you can also get this information through the web, going toyour Apple ID account page, then clicking on “Devices” in the left hand menu. The social networking giant offers a feature that lets you see where your account is logged in. Head to Facebook’s “Password and Security” settings and click on “Where you’re logged in.” In the same interface you can also see where you are logged in with your Instagram account, provided it’s linked to your Facebook account. If the accounts are not linked, or you just don’t have a Facebook account,go to Instagram’s “Account Center”to manage your Instagram account and click on Password and Security, and then “Where you’re logged in.” Here you can choose to log out from specific devices, perhaps because you don’t recognize them, or because they are old devices you don’t use anymore. Just like Google, Facebook offers anAdvanced Protectionfeatureas well as for Instagram, which essentially makes it harder for malicious hackers to log onto your account. “We’ll apply stricter rules at login to reduce the chances of unauthorized access to your account,” the company explains. “If we see anything unusual about a login to your account, we’ll ask you to complete extra steps to confirm it’s really you.” If you are a journalist, a politician or otherwise someone who is more likely at risk to be targeted by hackers, you may want to switch on this feature. In the past, it was only possible to use WhatsApp on one mobile device only. Now, Meta has added functionalities for WhatsApp users to use the app on computers, and also directly via browser. Checking where you logged in with your WhatsApp account is simple. Open the WhatsApp app on your mobile phone. On iPhones and iPads, tap on the Settings icon in the bottom right corner, then tap on “Linked devices.” There, you will be able to see a list of devices, and by clicking on one of them you can log them out. On Android, tap on the three dots in the top-right corner of the WhatsApp app, then tap “Linked devices” and you will see a page that’s very similar to what you would see on Apple devices. Like WhatsApp, Signal now lets you use the app viadedicated Desktop appsfor macOS, Windows, as well as Linux. From this screen of Linked Devices, you can tap on “Edit” and remove the devices, which means your account will be logged out and unlinked from those devices. To see where you are logged into X (formerly Twitter), go toX Settings, then click on “More” on the left-hand menu, click on “Settings and privacy,” then “Security and account access” and finally “Apps and sessions.” From this menu, you can see which apps you have connected to your X account, what sessions are open (such as where you are logged in) and the access history of your account. You can revoke access to all other devices and locations by hitting the “Log out of all other sessions” button. Snap has a feature that allows you to check where you are logged in. A Snapchatsupport page details the steps you can followto check. You can use both the app on iOS and Android, orSnapchat’s website. On iOS and Android, open the app, tap on your profile icon, then the settings (gear) icon, then tap on “Session Management.” At that point you will be able to see a list of sessions your account is logged into. It looks like this: On the web, go toSnapchat Accounts, then click on “Session Management.” There you will see a list of logged-in sessions that looks essentially the same as the image above. Both on the web and in the app, you can log out of sessions that seem suspicious or you don’t recognize. Snapchat also has a security feature that alerts you on your phone when someone is logging into your account, whether it’s you or a would-be intruder. TechCrunch tested this sign-in flow on different devices. The notification above may not display if you log back into a device you had already logged into. But if Snapchat thinks a login is “suspicious” — perhaps because the person logging in is using a different device or IP address — the app will show whoever is attempting to log in a new screen asking them to verify the phone number associated with the account, showing only the last four digits. If the person attempting the login then taps “Continue,” the account owner will receive a text message on their phone number with a code, which prevents the other person from logging in. However, you will only get this alert after the person has entered your correct password. That’s all the more reason to make sure you use a long and unique password, which makes passwords harder to guess, and enable multi-factor authentication with an authenticator app, rather than your phone number.

Meta,Why do so many home robots still suck?,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/01/why-do-so-many-home-robots-still-suck/,"7:00 AM PDT • September 1, 2024","Comment “The Jetsons” debuted September 23, 1962. The first episode, titled “Rosey the Robot,” was an origin story of sorts for the titular character, describing how an overworked Jane hired the housekeeper. Sixty-two years after her debut, Rosey remains an important pop cultural touchstone for the unfulfilled promise of home robots. The home of 2024 isn’t necessarily wholly devoid of robots. According to its own figures, iRobot has sold more than50 million Roombas. That, meanwhile, is a fraction of the overall number of robot vacuums that have been sold around the globe. Robot lawnmowers and pool cleaners have gained traction as well, though those figures pale in comparison to their vacuuming counterparts. Home robots’ unfulfilled potential isn’t because of a lack of consumer demand or lack of effort from manufacturers. It’s more complicated and nuanced than that, though ultimately it’s a matter of pricing, functionality and efficacy. Outside of the aforementioned use cases, today’s home robots don’t do enough or do what they do well enough, and building a robot that can tick both of those boxes would prove prohibitively expensive for those of us who can’t afford our own islands. During his long tenure as iRobot CEO, co-founder Colin Angle was fond of saying that he didn’t become a successful roboticist until he became a vacuum salesman. It’s a fun quip that gets to something much deeper about the industry. Before the Roomba came along, the company had experimented with everything from baby dolls to military equipment. iRobot found success when it focused on a simple task: cleaning floors. The earliest models were primitive by today’s standards, but they got the job done well enough to justify their price point. In addition to marking 62 years since Rosey’s TV debut, next month is also the Roomba’s 22nd anniversary. The robot vacuum is old enough to legallybuy a case of Sam Adams. In the nearly quarter century since the Roomba launched, much of iRobot’s R&D has gone into making the system smarter, adding sensing, mapping, and AI and integrating with smart assistants. The company has invested into other robotics categories as well, including gutter clearing, pool cleaning and a lawnmower that may never see the light of day, but all have failed to recapture the Roomba’s magic. Years ago, I appeared on a panel to discuss robots. The moment the conversation ended and the Q&A began, a woman’s hand shot up, front and center. She was eager to tell me about her billion-dollar idea: a drone that vacuums, dusts surfaces and does the laundry. I told her it was a great idea and I would happily buy one from her when she got it up and running. Everything in robotics is easier said than done. It isn’t that no one before her came up with the concept for a furniture-dusting drone; it’s that no one before her figured out how to build a reliable and robust version at scale with a price tag that isn’t higher than my 30-year mortgage. I thought back to that moment when Tesla announced itsrobot by way of a dancer in a spandex onesie. Elon Musk described a humanoid that would toil away all day at the factory and then pick up your groceries on the way home, before preparing your dinner. Musk has been in the public eye long enough to know precisely how much stock one should put in his timelines. Before the fully functioning Roseys of the world arrive, simpler machines are going to have to pave the way. Robots have had a place in manufacturing for decades, but they’ve been built to do one job well over and over again. The more complex the machine, the more expensive it gets and the more potential points of failure emerge. Think about how many ways your Roomba has failed and multiply that by the complexity of a humanoid. Most experts agree that early home robots will be designed for a handful of simple tasks: social robots and those providing caregiving and doing housework. For the foreseeable future, each will be designed with one or two functions in mind. There’s a sense of frustration that home systems are nowhere near where expected by this point in time. What regularly gets lost in that conversation, however, is the amount of groundwork that has already been laid. Whoever builds the next great home robot won’t have done so in a vacuum. Their success will be built not only on top of ongoing research, but also on the home robots that came before. Navigating in an environment as unstructured and dynamic as the home likely felt impossible for many before the first Roomba arrived. Again, it was a simple machine by today’s standards, but it laid the foundation for what comes next. One can see reflections of this in the current crop of home robots. TakeHello Robot. As design goes, it’s an extremely simplistic machine. It’s an arm attached to a pole attached to a Roomba-like base. Its simplicity is, in part, because it’s more development platform than product. But systems like this or, say,Matic’s robot vacuum, are continuing the hard work of building foundations, be they mapping, manipulation or navigation. Social home robots had a rough year in 2019. Anki, Kuri and Jino all fell in quick succession, each for a combination of price, limited functionality and reliability. More recently,Amazon’s Astrohas beendead in the water, effectively kneecapped after Amazon’s belt tightening wiped out a significant portion of the company’s consumer hardware headcount. Of course, had the $1,600 robot been a wild success, the retail giant almost certainly wouldn’t have let it die a quiet death. Amazon’s struggles are a friendly reminder that being one of the world’s largest companies doesn’t guarantee success in such a treacherous category. And following the Vision Pro’s lukewarm reception, one has to wonder whether Apple might be walking a similar road with itsreported home robot play. A more recentreport suggested that the first project out of the group could look less like Amazon’s Astro and more like its Echo Show 10. The potential product has been described as something along the lines of an iPad-like tablet mounted to an arm. These are reports of nascent projects, which could go any number of ways, but as it stands, this sounds more in line with where the company’s robotic ambitions ought to be. Home robots are coming, but when they arrive, they’ll still have a long way to go. That said, Jane won’t bring home Rosey until 2062, so we’ve got time. Update:Amazon tells TechCrunch that reports of Astro’s demise have been greatly exaggerated. The company notes that the robot is still available through its Day One program and “Amazon is still fully committed to our vision of bringing world-class consumer robotics solutions to the home and excited about the in-home experiences we’re inventing for Astro.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Meta,"US tech giants fight Indian telcos’ bid to regulate internet services, pay for network usage",https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/20/us-tech-giants-fight-indian-telcos-bid-to-regulate-internet-services/,"1:12 AM PDT • August 20, 2024","Comment Global technology giants are pushing back against attempts by India’s telecom networks to bring internet services under stricter regulation, rejecting arguments that such measures are necessary to create a “level playing field” and address national security concerns. The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), a powerful industry body that represents Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix and Spotify, has forcefully argued against inclusion of the so-called over-the-top (OTT) services in theproposed regulatory framework(PDF) for telecom operators. In a submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the AIC said there are fundamental differences in technology, operations and functionality between OTT services and traditional telecom operations. OTT services operate on the application layer, while telecom service providers (TSPs) operate on the network layer. Unlike TSPs, OTT providers do not have rights to acquire spectrum, obtain numbering resources or interconnect with the public switched telephone network. “OTT communication services are not substitutes of traditional telecom services,” the AIC wrote in its submission, noting that OTT services offer additional functionalities like group chats, voice notes and in-app content sharing. Including internet services in the new framework could violate net neutrality principles and harm consumer interests, the AIC warned. “At the outset, we would like to submit that OTT communication services are already regulated under a host of laws, including as ‘intermediaries’ under the IT Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. Thus, concerns that OTT communication services operate in an ecosystem where there is no regulatory oversight are unfounded,” the AIC also stated. The coalition argues there are already enough regulations in India that oversee OTT services, including requirements for interception, content takedown, incident reporting and user grievance redressal under the IT Act and related rules. This resistance comes in response to a coordinated push by India’s top telecom operators — Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea — to bring OTT services under a new authorization framework. Jio, India’s largest telecom operator with more than 475 million subscribers, and other telco operators have recommended that OTT providerscontribute to network development costsbased on their traffic consumption, turnover and user base. The telcos’ push comes as they grapple with low average revenue per user — of approximately $2 per month. Having collectivelyinvested $19 billion in 5G airwaves last year, the carriers are seeking regulatory intervention to boost margins. The AIC disputed claims of OTT services “free-riding” on telecom infrastructure. Jeff Paine, AIC’s managing director, said that OTT services have driven increased data consumption and revenues for carriers. The AIC also argued that regulating OTT services under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 would go beyond its intended scope. The coalition noted that when the Act was introduced in Parliament, the telecoms minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, clarified that “OTT has been regulated by the IT Act of 2000 and continues to be regulated by the IT Act” and also stipulated “there is no coverage of OTT in the new telecom bill passed by the Parliament.” The debate in India mirrors similar discussions in South Korea andEurope, where network operators are also pushing for contributions from large tech companies.

Meta,Amazon considers moving Amazon Pay into a standalone app in India,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/amazon-considers-moving-amazon-pay-into-a-standalone-app-in-india/,"1:56 AM PDT • August 19, 2024","Comment Amazon is considering shifting its payments offerings in India into a standalone app, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch, as the e-commerce giant aims to boost usage of Amazon Pay in the country. Amazon Pay is currently housed within the company’s primary e-commerce app in India, and lets users transfer money to individuals and merchants, pay bills, purchase insurance and travel tickets, invest in mutual funds and digital gold, and buy travel tickets. The U.S. tech giant has been contemplating decoupling its payments service from the e-commerce app for about a year and intends to proceed with the plan in the coming months, two of the sources said. Amazon has already reached out to the NPCI for approval, another person familiar with the matter said. The company has been told that it will likely have to issue fresh UPI IDs to users, sources familiar with the situation said, something Amazon sees as a thorny requirement. Some executives at Amazon believe Amazon Pay is not receiving adequate attention on the e-commerce app, one source said, adding that a separate app with a singular focus could help the payments platform gain wider recognition in the country. The sources requested anonymity as the discussions are confidential and ongoing. They cautioned that Amazon,grappling with many other challenges in India, may alter its plans and could still abandon the idea. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment, describing the news as speculation. Amazon Pay ranks sixth among apps on Unified Payments Interface, a payments network that is the most popular way Indians transact online. In July, Amazon Pay processed about 72.4 million transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of all transactions on the network, according to official data. In comparison, Walmart’s PhonePe processed 6.9 billion transactions, while Google Pay handled 5.3 billion. Amazon isn’t alone in weighing similar options in India, where China-style super app strategies haven’t seen much success. Its chief Indian rival, Flipkart, late last month consolidated its fintech offerings into one vertical, two years afterseparating from PhonePe. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Meta,"As Alexa turns 10, Amazon looks to generative AI",https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/10/as-alexa-turns-10-amazon-looks-to-generative-ai/,"2:00 PM PDT • August 10, 2024","Comment Amazon loses money on Echo smart speakers. It’s been an open secret for the duration of Alexa’s existence. It’s the product of the kind of loss leader strategy only a company of Amazon’s size can get away with for a decade. Selling hardware at a loss can be an effective strategy, of course. Think about printers and razors, which get corporate feet into the door and make up for the loss with ink cartridges and blades, respectively. From the perspective of saturation, Amazon’s strategy can be viewed as a success. Early this year, founderJeff Bezos claimedthat Alexa is now in 100 million homes, across 400 million devices. Financial realities paint a wholly different picture, however. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon’s devices divisionlost a staggering $25 billion in the five-year periodbetween 2017 and 2021. The Alexa divisionreportedly lost$10 billion in 2022 alone. At a certain point, a loss leader simply becomes a loss. That reality came crashing down at the end of 2023, whenseveral hundredwere laid off from the Alexa unit. Eleven-digit annual losses, coupled with a rough macroeconomic outlook, is an untenable situation, even for a company with $600 billion+ in annual revenue. Alexa isn’t the only smart assistant that has fallen back down to Earth in recent years. Beyond offerings like Bixby and Cortana, which went away entirely, consumer excitement around Google Assistant and Siri has also waned. In recent months, however, both Google and Apple have made it clear that they’re not ready to give up the ghost.Siri took center stageat WWDC in June, as Apple breathed new life into the brand, courtesy of its newApple Intelligence initiative. Google similarly confirmed this week that Assistant is getting aGemini-powered boostin the home. A 2021 report from Bloomberg noted that, despite Alexa’s popularity,a majority of queries involve one of three tasks: playing music, controlling lights and setting timers. A former Amazon senior employee put it even more starkly, speaking to WSJ: “We worried we’ve hired 10,000 people and we’ve built a smart timer.” With all the published criticism leveled at Alexa in its decade-long existence, that may well be the most effortlessly cutting. While the company has continued releasing Echo devices, including an upgraded Spotannounced last month, the company has taken its foot off the gas. No doubt there has been much soul searching among theSpheres. Much like Google and Apple, Amazon sees generative AI as the lifeline Alexa needs. The 10,000-person timer problem is a result of devices failing to live up to customer expectations. Entreatingthird-party developers to create skillshas been part of a larger push to make Alexa more useful. Amazon has also attempted to improve the assistant’s conversational skills over the years. In that respect, generative AI is a game changer. Platforms like ChatGPT have demonstrated incredible natural language conversational aptitude. Late last year, Amazon offered apreviewof Alexa’s generative AI-powered future. “We’ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we’ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014,” the company wrote. “A longstanding mission has been to make a conversation with Alexa as natural as talking to another human, and with the rapid development of generative AI, what we imagined is now well within reach.” November marks a decade since Alexa and Echo were announced. One couldn’t ask for better timing to unveil a picture of what the next 10 years might look like. Whether the assistant gets another decade will depend, in part, on how the next few months play out.

Meta,OpenAI faces more leadership shake-ups,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/10/openai-faces-more-leadership-shake-ups/,"10:05 AM PDT • August 10, 2024","Comment OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has leftthe company forrival AI startup Anthropic.In addition, OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave after nine years at the company to “relax and recharge.” Schulman said his decision stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment — the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended — and engage in more hands-on technical work. Google was found to have acted illegallyto maintain a monopoly in online search.The U.S. District Court decision, should it stand, is a major defeat for Google that could change the structure of the internet as we know it. The ruling alleges that Google abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. Google, naturally, says it will appeal. X filed an antitrust lawsuitagainst the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA). X CEO Linda Yaccarino accused the organizationsof a “systematic illegal boycott”of the platform. GARM was founded to “help the industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising.” Following the lawsuit, the WFA said it is“discontinuing” GARM’s operations.

Instagram,VC pitch show ‘Meet the Drapers’ partners with TikTok,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/06/vc-pitch-show-meet-the-drapers-partners-with-tiktok/,"9:44 AM PDT • September 6, 2024","Comment Venture capitalist Tim Draper’s international pitch competition, “Meet the Drapers,” is partnering up withTikTokas it heads into its seventh season. Under the new tie-up, entrepreneurs will pitch their startups to the public through the short-form video app for one of the show’s upcoming episodes. The general public will then be able to vote on their favorite submissions through a landing page in the app followed by a livestreamed pitch review on TikTok. This will all culminate in the selection of four finalists, who will compete on an episode of the show in front of judges in hopes of winning the $1 million investment from Tim Draper. For TikTok, the deal allows the company to position itself as a champion for small businesses at a time when its platform is under anincreasingly unpopular U.S. ban, while also allowing it to promote its educational offerings. Meanwhile, “Meet the Drapers” will benefit from the increased visibility provided by the popular video app. While shows like “Shark Tank” have brought the idea of the pitch-off competition to the mainstream public, “Meet the Drapers” explores tech entrepreneurship more directly. “We’re not looking for somebody who invented a gum scraper or…a new bikini company. That isn’t really what we’re after,” theentertaining and iconoclasticinvestor tells TechCrunch. “We’re funding something that 10 years from now is going to rock the world,” he adds. The episodes being developed in partnership with TikTok will likely lean toward consumer technology, given the platform and its audience. This is the first time “Meet the Drapers” has ever worked with TikTok. The show was previously streamed across various platforms, including its own website and YouTube, where the shows average half a million views. The program caters to a global audience, with shows filmed in areas including Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE (Dubai), Denmark and Taiwan, in addition to Silicon Valley — often in conjunction with Draper’s travels and speaking engagements in those markets. Plus, Draper believes that an entrepreneur can start from anywhere, which is why he appreciates the pitch-off show’s global footprint. “We actually think of this show as proselytizing and spreading entrepreneurship in kind of a viral way,” Draper says. The pitches generally focus on areas that Draper likes to invest in, including space and transportation, the digitization of medicine, AI, bitcoin and more. The seventh season of the show has already been filmed and is being readied for release, making the TikTok partnership a part of season eight. Guest judges for the TikTok show have not yet been announced. Small businesses that want to be considered will showcase their entrepreneurial journey in 30- to 60-second TikTok videos. Applications are accepted through Saturday, September 7. The first round of finalists will participate in a livestreamed pitch review event September 25-27, and the overall winner will be announced September 30. Typically, Draper sets aside more cash than the million-dollar prize to award to show participants, which means even runners-up will gain a smaller investment. On the show’s website, it’s noted that the second-place winner receives $500,000 and third place gets $250,000. “We never talk about this, but we always allocate about two to three million per year,” Draper notes. Last year, for instance, the runner-up got a half-million investment while others received $250,000 investments. A small handful of past participants have also received $50,000 investments. One of the more notable winners of the show has been tiny-home startup Boxabl, though that company hasstruggled to reach profitability, and has been underSEC inquiry. Other winners have included at-home health testing serviceVivoo,CancerFree Biotech, drone startupBONV, team collaboration softwareBalloonand health food companyIt’s Skinny. In the finale, the entrepreneurs also have to reveal their valuation, he adds. In total, Draper estimates the show has made somewhere around 35 to 40 investments to date. Overall, as an investor, Draper has backed companies like Baidu, Hotmail, Skype, Tesla, SpaceX, AngelList, SolarCity, Ring, Twitter, Docusign, Coinbase, Robinhood, Twitch, Cruise and others, as well as, more controversially,Theranos.

Instagram,TikTok’s new ‘Manage Topics’ tool gives you more control over your For You feed; here’s how to use it,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/30/tiktoks-new-manage-topics-tool-gives-you-more-control-over-your-for-you-feed-heres-how-to-use-it/,"6:49 AM PDT • August 30, 2024","Comment TikTok is introducing a new“Manage Topics”feature that will give you more control over what you see on your For You feed, the company announced on Friday. The new feature is rolling out to users in the U.S. With the new tool, you can tailor your For You feed to show you more or less of certain topics. You can access the feature by going into your Settings, selecting “Content Preferences” and then clicking the “Manage Topics” option. From there, you can customize your preferences for different topics, such as sports, travel, humor, current affairs, dance, and food. You can do so by moving the slider to adjust how much you do or don’t want to see that sort of content in your For You feed. If you are uncertain about which type of videos fall under a category, you can click the “information” button next to a topic. For instance, TikTok says the “Creative arts” topic includes “painting, drawing, graphic design, and art-related tutorials.” TikTok says these selections will help the app either show more or less of a topic in your For You feed. Of course, this doesn’t impact the content you see from accounts you follow. The company notes that it may take some time for the app to personalize your feed based on your selections, so don’t expect the customization to be applied instantly. Although TikTok introduced a feature last year that allowed you torefresh your For Youfeed to retrain the app’s algorithm about the content you enjoy, this new feature lets you take a more focused approach to customizing what you see on the platform instead of just starting over fresh. And, while you can individually hold down on a video to click the “not interested” button to signal to the algorithm that you don’t want to see a certain type of video, you can now go directly into your settings and tell the app you don’t want to see that sort of content on your For You feed. It’s worth noting that although you can already select keywords and hashtags to filter out content from your For You feed, this new feature gets rid of having to manually enter a bunch of things you don’t want to see.

Instagram,TikTok comes for messaging apps with the addition of group chats,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/tiktok-comes-for-messaging-apps-with-the-addition-of-group-chats/,"11:01 AM PDT • August 12, 2024","Comment TikTok looks to be taking on popular messaging services like Meta’s WhatsApp and Apple’s Messages, as the companyannouncedon Monday that it’s adding group chats to its platform. You can now create group chats with up to 32 people to chat and share content together. While people often share TikTok videos with each other in group chats on messaging apps, TikTok is now letting users do so within its own platform. Users can now watch, comment and react together all on TikTok. The latest addition indicates that TikTok is interested in making its platform more social and a place for conversation with friends, not just an entertainment platform where you interact with strangers. As with individual messages, group chats are only available to users above the age of 15. TikTok says it has added safety measures to protect teens between the ages of 16 and 17. Everyone, including teens, can only be added to a group chat by a mutual follower. If a teen gets an invite to join a group chat, they can’t join unless the group has at least one mutual friend in it. Plus, when a teen creates a group chat, TikTok will require them to review and approve new joiners. You can create a group chat by tapping the “Chat” button at the top of your inbox and then selecting “More options.” Then, you can select the friends you want to include in the group and then click “Start group chat.” To join an existing group chat through an invite, you can tap on the invite and then click “Join group.” TikTok also announced that it’s rolling out custom stickers in DMs. The company sees the feature as a fun chat option that encourages users to create and upload their own custom stickers for everyone to use.

Instagram,TikTok partners with Warner Bros. to become a discovery engine for TV and movies,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/08/tiktok-spotlight-feature-warner-bros-partnership/,"6:00 AM PDT • August 8, 2024","Comment TikTok’s latest offering is capitalizing on the app’s ability to serve as a discovery engine for other media — something its users already take advantage of by sharing short clips of movies and TV shows. Today, the company is partnering with studios like Warner Bros. to launch a feature that lets users discover movies and TV shows through the short-form video app. The new feature, called “Spotlight,” appears on videos related to a film or series, and directs users to a dedicated landing page where they can learn additional information about the title, such as the synopsis, and cast, as well as short video content from creators. From the landing page, users can watch the title on streaming services (such as Max), rent on-demand, or buy movie tickets to see it in theaters. Videos that qualify for Spotlight links must have a certain number of views and creators with a decent following. Creators participating in a Spotlight campaign can earn various incentives, such as exclusive frames for their profile photo, filters, merchandise, movie tickets and even access to red-carpet events. Warner Bros., with its vast IP library of popular titles, is using Spotlight to promote the second season of “House of the Dragon.” It’s currently rewarding creators for posting videos about the show — whether that be a review, funny skit, makeup tutorial, and so on — with a limited profile frame for their preferred House: Team Green or Team Black. Creators who qualify must post a 60-second video (using the hashtag #HOTD) that doesn’t violate TikTok’s policies. The entertainment giant first experimented with the feature in February when it promoted “Dune: Part Two” on the platform. This resulted in more than 260,000 fan-created posts in the two weeks leading up to the movie premiere, according to TikTok. At launch, Spotlight will only be available to a select number of studios. Over time, the feature could serve not only as a tool for finding new things to watch or stream, but could also help cement TikTok’s place as a first stop for media-focused discovery, ahead of Google. With the recentantitrust rulingagainst Google as well as the rise of AI, which sees companies like Perplexity andOpenAI building their own search tools, TikTok’s latest move represents yet another way Google’s dominance may be challenged in the months to come. In the past, TikTok has provided marketing solutions for movie studio marketers, includingShowtimes: movie trailer ads that display a “Get Showtimes” button to help users find nearby theater options and showtimes. The company has also previously teamed up with ticketing companiesTicketmasterandAXSto let users purchase tickets for concerts and other live events directly through TikTok. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Instagram,TikTok Lite: EU closes addictive design case after TikTok commits to not bring back rewards mechanism,https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/tiktok-lite-eu-closes-addictive-design-case-after-tiktok-commits-to-not-bring-back-rewards-mechanism/,"4:22 AM PDT • August 5, 2024","Comment The European Commission has closed a Digital Services Act (DSA) investigation of a rewards feature in TikTok Lite by accepting commitments from the social media giant to permanently withdraw the feature from the EU. The TikTok Lite “task and reward” mechanism, launched in France and Spain earlier this year, lets users earn points for doing in-app activities like watching and liking videos. These points could be exchanged for Amazon vouchers. TikTok Lite is an alternative, lower-bandwidth version of TikTok’s app that the company offers in some markets. TikTok has also agreed not to try and circumvent its commitment, such as by launching the same feature under a different name or deploying a version that serves as an equivalent alternative, according to the Commission. Although the settlement applies to the TikTok Lite reward mechanism the EU was investigating, it’s not a blanket ban on TikTok launching any rewards features in the future. When the EU opened a probe of the rewards featureback in April, the Commission said it was worried the design of the mechanism might negatively impact the mental health of young users by “stimulating addictive behavior.” TikTok hadtemporarily suspendedthe rewards mechanism in the EU soon after the Commission launched its investigation. The EU had threatened to use interim powers to shut down the feature while it investigated concerns that it was encouraging people to spend excessive amounts of time on the app. Briefing journalists on background, a senior Commission official said the enforcer is happy with the outcome as it has delivered a quick result that enables EU citizens, including minors, to be protected. The settlement does mean the EC has not formally found TikTok to be in breach of the DSA, so there’s no penalty. However, if TikTok fails to keep to its commitments, the Commission emphasized that the company could be sanctioned immediately under the DSA, which allows for fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover without the need for a fresh investigation. So TikTok has a pretty big compliance incentive here. The Commission said it would monitor TikTok’s compliance to its commitments using existing processes and DSA powers, including with the help of Member State-level authorities that oversee compliance with the regulation’s general rules. Commenting in a statement, Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said: “The available brain time of young Europeans is not a currency for social media — and it never will be. We have obtained the permanent withdrawal of TikTok Lite Rewards programme, which could have had very addictive consequences. The DSA is in full swing.” TikTok spokesperson Elliot Burton sent TechCrunch a statement about the settlement: “We always seek to engage constructively with the European Commission and other regulators. TikTok is pleased to have reached an amicable resolution and has now withdrawn the TikTok Lite rewards programme which was launched in France and Spain in April, which we had already voluntarily suspended.” While this TikTok DSA case is now closed, another, more wide-ranging investigation announcedback in Februaryis still ongoing. That case concerns the main TikTok app’s algorithm, among other areas. The Commission has said it’s worried the design of the tracking-based recommender engine may lead to “rabbit hole effects,” where users who view one video on a topic can be recommended more extreme videos that could lead to an amplification of harmful content, such as videos promoting eating disorders. The EU is also concerned TikTok is not using robust enough age-assurance measures to protect kids from accessing inappropriate content. TikTok’s compliance with DSA transparency requirements are also being investigated.
